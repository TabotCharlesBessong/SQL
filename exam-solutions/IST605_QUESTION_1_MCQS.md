## Answers

### Question (a) - Experimental Design

**Question:** Refer to the figure above. The figure illustrates a typical experiment in

**Answer: D) cognitive psychology**

**Explanation:** The figure shows a typical experimental setup in cognitive psychology with sensory input → participant processing information → report/press button. This is characteristic of cognitive psychology experiments that study mental processes like perception, memory, and decision-making.

### Question (b) - Absolute Threshold

**Question:** ______ refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy required to be detected most of the time.

**Answer: A) absolute threshold**

**Explanation:** The absolute threshold is the minimum intensity of a stimulus needed for detection 50% of the time.

---

### Question (c) - Transduction

**Question:** ______ involves the conversion of sensory stimulus energy into neural impulses.

**Answer: D) transduction**

**Explanation:** Transduction is the process by which sensory receptors convert physical stimuli (light, sound, etc.) into neural signals that can be processed by the brain.

---

### Question (d) - Binocular Depth Cues

**Question:** ______ depth cues require the use of both eyes.

**Answer: B) binocular**

**Explanation:** Binocular depth cues (like retinal disparity and convergence) require both eyes to perceive depth. Monocular cues can be perceived with one eye.

---

### Question (e) - Perception

**Question:** ______ occurs when sensory information is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced.

**Answer: B) perception**

**Explanation:** Perception is the process of organizing, interpreting, and consciously experiencing sensory information. Sensation is the initial detection of stimuli.

---

### Question (f) - Proximity Principle

**Question:** According to the principle of ______, objects that occur close to one another tend to be grouped together.

**Answer: C) proximity**

**Explanation:** The Gestalt principle of proximity states that objects that are close together are perceived as a group.

---

### Question (g) - Closure Principle

**Question:** Our tendency to perceive things as complete objects rather than as a series of parts is known as the principle of

**Answer: A) closure**

**Explanation:** The principle of closure refers to our tendency to perceive incomplete objects as complete, filling in gaps to form whole objects.

---

### Question (h) - Figure-Ground

**Question:** The main point of focus in a visual display is known as the

**Answer: D) figure**

**Explanation:** In figure-ground perception, the figure is the main focus (the object of attention), while the ground is the background.

---

### Question (i) - Three Functions of Memory

**Question:** The three functions of memory are ______.

**Answer: D) encoding, storage, and retrieval**

**Explanation:** The three core functions of memory are:
1. **Encoding:** Getting information into memory
2. **Storage:** Maintaining information over time
3. **Retrieval:** Getting information out of memory

---

### Question (j) - Recency Effect

**Question:** Immediately testing recall can lead to greater recall for words at the end of a list. This is ______

**Answer: A) recency effect**

**Explanation:** The recency effect is the tendency to better recall items at the end of a list, often because they are still in short-term/working memory.

---

### Question (k) - Working Memory

**Question:** ______ is a memory store with a phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, episodic buffer, and a central executive.

**Answer: C) working memory**

**Explanation:** Working memory (as proposed by Baddeley and Hitch) consists of:
- Phonological loop (verbal/auditory information)
- Visuospatial sketchpad (visual and spatial information)
- Episodic buffer (integrates information)
- Central executive (controls attention and coordinates subsystems)

---

### Question (l) - Working Memory Capacity

**Question:** The storage capacity of working memory is ______.

**Answer: B) seven bits, plus or minus two**

**Explanation:** George Miller's research showed that working memory capacity is approximately 7±2 items (the "magic number 7").

---

### Question (m) - Long-Term Memory Capacity

**Question:** The storage capacity of long-term memory is ______.

**Answer: D) essentially limitless**

**Explanation:** Long-term memory has essentially unlimited storage capacity, unlike working memory which is limited.
