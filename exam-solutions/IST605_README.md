## Answer Summary

### Question 1 (MCQs) - Answer Key
1. (a) D - cognitive psychology
2. (b) A - absolute threshold
3. (c) D - transduction
4. (d) B - binocular
5. (e) B - perception
6. (f) C - proximity
7. (g) A - closure
8. (h) D - figure
9. (i) D - encoding, storage, and retrieval
10. (j) A - recency effect
11. (k) C - working memory
12. (l) B - seven bits, plus or minus two
13. (m) D - essentially limitless

### Question 2 - Three Stages of Memory
1. **Sensory Memory:** 250ms-4s duration, large capacity, raw sensory form
2. **Short-Term Memory:** 15-30s duration, 7±2 items capacity, active maintenance
3. **Long-Term Memory:** Permanent duration, essentially limitless capacity, organized storage

### Question 3 - Object Recognition Theories
- **Feature Detection:** Recognition based on basic features (lines, edges, angles)
- **Structural Theories:** Recognition based on parts and their spatial relationships (geons)
- **Template Matching:** Recognition by comparing to stored exact patterns

### Question 4 - Free Recall Analysis
- **Free recall task:** Recall items in any order after presentation
- **Primacy effect:** Better recall of early items (present in both curves)
- **Recency effect:** Better recall of late items (present only in no-delay curve)
- **Serial position effect:** U-shaped pattern of recall across positions
- **Key difference:** Delay eliminates recency effect but not primacy effect

## Study Tips

1. **Memory Systems:** Understand the distinctions between sensory memory, STM/working memory, and LTM (duration, capacity, function)

2. **Serial Position Effects:**
   - Primacy = beginning items (LTM)
   - Recency = end items (STM/working memory)
   - Delay eliminates recency but not primacy

3. **Perception vs. Sensation:**
   - Sensation = detection of stimuli
   - Perception = interpretation and organization of sensory information

4. **Gestalt Principles:** Know proximity, closure, similarity, good continuation, and figure-ground

5. **Object Recognition:** Understand how each theory explains object recognition differently

## Important Theories & Models

### Memory Models
- **Atkinson-Shiffrin Model:** Three-stage model of memory
- **Baddeley-Hitch Working Memory Model:** Four-component model (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, episodic buffer, central executive)
- **Miller's Magic Number:** 7±2 items in STM

### Object Recognition Models
- **Template Matching:** Exact pattern matching
- **Feature Detection:** Feature analysis (Hubel & Wiesel)
- **Recognition-by-Components (RBC):** Biederman's geon-based theory

### Serial Position Effects
- **Primacy Effect:** Long-term memory encoding through rehearsal
- **Recency Effect:** Short-term/working memory availability
- **Dual-Store Model:** Explains why delay affects recency but not primacy

## Graph Analysis Tips (Question 4)

When analyzing the serial position curve:
1. Look for **U-shape** pattern (primacy + recency)
2. Identify **primacy** (high recall at beginning)
3. Identify **recency** (high recall at end)
4. Note **middle items** (lower recall)
5. Compare **delay vs. no-delay** conditions:
   - Delay eliminates recency (STM decay)
   - Primacy remains (LTM persistence)
