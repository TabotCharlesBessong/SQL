## QUESTION 2: THREE STAGES OF MEMORY (6 marks)

### Summary Table

| Stage | What Happens | Duration | Capacity |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Sensory Memory** | Stored in original form; attention selects | 250ms-4s | Large but decays rapidly |
| **Short-Term Memory** | Actively maintained; can encode to LTM | 15-30s (without rehearsal) | 7 ± 2 items |
| **Long-Term Memory** | Organized in networks; retrievable | Relatively permanent | Essentially limitless |

### Key Points

1. **Sensory Memory:**
   - Iconic (visual): ~250-500ms
   - Echoic (auditory): ~2-4s
   - Large capacity, rapid decay

2. **Short-Term Memory:**
   - Also called Working Memory
   - Components: phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, episodic buffer, central executive
   - Miller's magic number: 7±2 items

3. **Long-Term Memory:**
   - Unlimited capacity
   - Permanent storage
   - Organized in networks

## QUESTION 3: OBJECT RECOGNITION THEORIES (6 marks)

### (i) Feature Detection Theories
- Recognition by detecting basic features (lines, edges, curves, angles)
- Feature detectors respond to specific features
- Example: "A" recognized by detecting diagonal lines and horizontal line
- Hubel & Wiesel: discovered feature-detecting neurons
- **Core:** Recognition based on distinctive features

### (ii) Structural Theories
- Recognition by identifying parts and their spatial relationships
- Biederman's Recognition-by-Components (RBC): 36 geons combine to form objects
- Focus on relationships (above, below, beside, connected)
- Viewpoint-invariant recognition
- **Core:** Parts + spatial relationships

### (iii) Template Matching Theory
- Recognition by comparing to stored exact patterns/templates
- Requires normalization for size, position, orientation
- Limitation: Too many templates needed
- Useful for standardized objects (letters, numbers)
- **Core:** Direct comparison to stored exact representations

## QUESTION 4: FREE RECALL TASK (6 marks)

### Part (a) - Definition
**Answer:** In a free recall task, subjects are presented with a list of items (e.g., words) and are asked to recall them in any order after the presentation is complete.

---

### Part (b) - Graph Analysis

#### (i) General Recall Fraction
- **No delay:** 20-70% (varies by position), average ~30-40%
- **30-sec delay:** 20-70% for first items, 20-30% for others, average ~25-30%

#### (ii) Primacy Effect
- Better recall of **beginning items** (positions 1-3)
- **No delay:** ~70% correct
- **30-sec delay:** ~60-70% correct
- **Explanation:** Early items receive more rehearsal, encoded into LTM

#### (iii) Recency Effect
- Better recall of **end items** (positions 13-15)
- **No delay:** ~50-55% correct (recency effect present)
- **30-sec delay:** ~20-30% correct (recency effect **eliminated**)
- **Explanation:** End items still in STM when immediately tested; delay allows STM decay

#### (iv) Serial Positioning Effect
- **U-shaped curve:** High recall at beginning (primacy) and end (recency), low in middle
- **No delay:** Clear U-shape pattern
- **30-sec delay:** U-shape with missing recency (no rise at end)
- Shows that memory performance depends on item position in sequence

#### (v) Differences and Similarities

**Similarities:**
1. Both show primacy effect (60-70% for positions 1-3)
2. Both show low recall for middle items (20-30%)
3. Both demonstrate serial position pattern

**Differences:**
1. **Recency effect:**
   - No delay: Present (50-55% for end items)
   - 30-sec delay: **Eliminated** (20-30% for end items)

2. **Overall recall:**
   - No delay: Higher overall recall
   - 30-sec delay: Lower overall recall, especially at end

3. **Curve shape:**
   - No delay: U-shaped curve
   - 30-sec delay: Decaying curve (no rise at end)

4. **Memory systems:**
   - No delay: LTM (primacy) + STM (recency)
   - 30-sec delay: Primarily LTM (primacy only)

## Key Concepts Summary

### Memory Stages
- **Sensory:** Very brief (ms to seconds), large capacity
- **STM:** 15-30s, 7±2 items
- **LTM:** Permanent, unlimited capacity

### Serial Position Effects
- **Primacy:** Beginning items (LTM-based, unaffected by delay)
- **Recency:** End items (STM-based, eliminated by delay)
- **Middle items:** Low recall in both conditions

### Object Recognition
- **Template:** Exact matching
- **Feature:** Basic feature detection
- **Structural:** Parts + relationships (geons)

### Perception Principles
- **Gestalt:** Proximity, closure, similarity, good continuation
- **Depth cues:** Binocular (both eyes) vs. monocular (one eye)
- **Figure-ground:** Figure (focus) vs. ground (background)
