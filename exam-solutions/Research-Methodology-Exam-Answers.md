## QUESTION 1 (6 marks)

### (i) Define a research question.

**Answer:**

A **research question** is a clear, focused, and specific inquiry that guides a research study. It defines what the researcher wants to investigate, understand, or discover. A well-formulated research question:

- **Addresses a specific problem or gap** in existing knowledge
- **Is answerable** through empirical investigation or systematic analysis
- **Is clear and unambiguous**, avoiding vague or overly broad statements
- **Is feasible** to investigate within available resources and time constraints
- **Has theoretical or practical significance** to the field of study

Research questions differ from research objectives in that they are phrased as questions rather than statements, and they serve as the foundation for developing hypotheses, selecting research methods, and determining data collection strategies.

### (ii) Examine the following research question and identify the independent and dependent variables:

**Research Question:** "Does a mathematics tutorial program improve students' performance in mathematics?"

**Answer:**

- **Independent Variable:** The mathematics tutorial program (or participation in the program)
  - This is the variable that is manipulated, introduced, or varied by the researcher
  - It can be operationalized as: presence/absence of the tutorial program, or different types/intensities of tutorial programs
  - It is the "cause" or "treatment" being tested

- **Dependent Variable:** Students' performance in mathematics
  - This is the variable that is measured or observed to see if it changes in response to the independent variable
  - It can be operationalized as: test scores, grades, problem-solving ability, or other measurable indicators of mathematical performance
  - It is the "effect" or "outcome" being studied

**Relationship:** The research question investigates whether changes in the independent variable (tutorial program) cause changes in the dependent variable (mathematics performance).

### (iii) A researcher analyzed historical data and found the following results:

#### a) Identify the kind of research involved.

**Answer:**

The kind of research involved is **Correlational Research** (also known as **Observational Research** or **Non-experimental Research**).

**Characteristics:**
- Uses **historical/archival data** that was collected in the past
- Examines **relationships between variables** without manipulating them
- **No random assignment** or experimental control
- **Retrospective analysis** of existing data
- Cannot establish causation, only associations/correlations

This is distinct from experimental research because the researcher does not control or manipulate variables; they only observe and analyze existing relationships in the data.

---

#### b) Summarize each result and indicate whether causation was established. If not, explain why.

**Result 1: Incidence of diabetes and blood sugar levels**

**Summary:**
The research found a relationship between the incidence of diabetes and blood sugar levels. This likely means that individuals with higher blood sugar levels showed a higher incidence of diabetes, or vice versa.

**Causation Established?** **NO**

**Explanation:**
- **Correlation does not imply causation**: While there is a strong association, the direction of causality is unclear from correlational data alone
- **Third variable problem**: Other factors (genetics, diet, exercise, age) could be causing both high blood sugar and diabetes
- **Reverse causality**: It's unclear whether high blood sugar causes diabetes or diabetes causes high blood sugar
- **No experimental control**: Without manipulating blood sugar levels in a controlled experiment, we cannot establish a causal relationship
- **Temporal ambiguity**: Historical data may not establish the temporal sequence needed for causation

---

**Result 2: Height and reading time**

**Summary:**
The research found a relationship between height and reading time. This could mean that taller individuals read for different durations than shorter individuals, or there is some association between these variables.

**Causation Established?** **NO**

**Explanation:**
- **Spurious correlation**: Height and reading time are likely not causally related; any correlation is probably due to confounding variables
- **Age as a confounder**: Age is likely the true causal factor - younger children are typically shorter AND read less (or more, depending on the study), while adults are taller AND have different reading habits
- **No logical mechanism**: There is no plausible biological or psychological mechanism by which height directly causes changes in reading time
- **Third variable problem**: Variables like age, education level, or developmental stage could explain both height and reading time
- **Correlational design limitation**: The historical data analysis cannot control for these confounding factors

---

**Result 3: Stress levels and alertness**

**Summary:**
The research found a relationship between stress levels and alertness. This likely indicates that individuals with higher stress levels showed different levels of alertness compared to those with lower stress levels.

**Causation Established?** **NO**

**Explanation:**
- **Bidirectional relationship**: Stress could affect alertness, but alertness (or lack thereof) could also affect stress levels - the direction of causality is unclear
- **Third variable problem**: Factors like sleep quality, workload, health conditions, or lifestyle choices could influence both stress and alertness
- **Individual differences**: Personality traits, coping mechanisms, or genetic factors might affect both variables independently
- **Measurement issues**: Historical data may have measurement errors or inconsistencies that affect the relationship
- **No experimental manipulation**: Without experimentally manipulating stress levels and controlling other variables, causation cannot be established
- **Contextual factors**: The relationship might vary depending on the type of stress, duration, or individual characteristics

**Note:** While stress might logically seem to affect alertness, correlational research with historical data cannot establish this causal relationship definitively. Experimental research with random assignment would be needed to establish causation.

## QUESTION 2 (9 marks)

### (i) Explain the difference between descriptive and experimental research.

**Answer:**

**Descriptive Research:**

- **Purpose**: To describe, observe, and document characteristics, behaviors, or phenomena as they naturally occur
- **Manipulation**: **No manipulation** of variables - researcher observes without intervention
- **Control**: **Minimal or no control** over variables or conditions
- **Causality**: **Cannot establish causation** - only describes what exists or what relationships exist
- **Methods**: Surveys, observations, case studies, correlational studies, archival research
- **When to use**: When you want to understand "what is" or "what exists" without changing anything
- **Example**: Surveying students about their study habits, observing classroom behavior, analyzing historical data

**Experimental Research:**

- **Purpose**: To determine cause-and-effect relationships by manipulating variables and controlling conditions
- **Manipulation**: **Active manipulation** of the independent variable(s) by the researcher
- **Control**: **High level of control** - researcher controls extraneous variables, uses control groups, random assignment
- **Causality**: **Can establish causation** through controlled manipulation and comparison
- **Methods**: Laboratory experiments, field experiments, quasi-experiments, randomized controlled trials
- **When to use**: When you want to determine "what causes what" or test hypotheses about causal relationships
- **Example**: Testing whether a new teaching method (manipulated) improves test scores (measured) compared to a control group

**Key Differences Summary:**

| Aspect | Descriptive Research | Experimental Research |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Variable Manipulation** | None | Active manipulation |
| **Control** | Minimal | High |
| **Causality** | Cannot establish | Can establish |
| **Purpose** | Describe/observe | Test cause-effect |
| **Design** | Observational | Controlled intervention |

### (ii) Answer the following questions related to survey research:

#### a) Describe open-ended and close-ended questions.

**Answer:**

**Open-ended Questions:**

- **Definition**: Questions that allow respondents to answer in their own words, without predetermined response options
- **Format**: Free-text responses, narrative answers
- **Advantages**:
  - Provide **rich, detailed information** and unexpected insights
  - Allow respondents to express **nuanced opinions** and personal perspectives
  - Can reveal **underlying reasons, motivations, or contexts** not anticipated by the researcher
  - Avoid forcing respondents into categories that may not fit their views
  - Useful for **exploratory research** and generating new hypotheses
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Time-consuming** to answer and analyze
  - **Difficult to code and quantify** for statistical analysis
  - May produce **irrelevant or off-topic responses**
  - **Lower response rates** due to effort required
  - **Subjective interpretation** required during analysis
- **Example**: "What factors do you think contribute to student success in online learning?"

**Close-ended Questions:**

- **Definition**: Questions that provide respondents with a fixed set of predetermined response options to choose from
- **Format**: Multiple choice, yes/no, rating scales (Likert), ranking, checkboxes
- **Advantages**:
  - **Quick and easy** for respondents to answer
  - **Easy to code and analyze** statistically
  - **Standardized responses** allow for comparison across respondents
  - **Higher response rates** due to lower effort
  - **Reduced ambiguity** in responses
  - Suitable for **large sample sizes** and quantitative analysis
- **Disadvantages**:
  - May **force respondents** into categories that don't accurately represent their views
  - **Limited depth** of information
  - May **miss important nuances** or unexpected perspectives
  - **Response options** may bias answers (response set bias)
  - Less useful for **exploratory research**
- **Example**: "How satisfied are you with online learning? (1) Very satisfied (2) Satisfied (3) Neutral (4) Dissatisfied (5) Very dissatisfied"

**Best Practice**: Many effective surveys use a combination of both types - close-ended questions for quantitative data and open-ended questions for qualitative insights.

#### b) Distinguish between population and sample.

**Answer:**

**Population:**

- **Definition**: The **entire group** of individuals, objects, events, or cases that the researcher wants to study and make inferences about
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Complete set** of all units of interest
  - Defined by specific **criteria or boundaries** (e.g., all students at University of Buea, all employees in a company)
  - The **target group** for generalization of research findings
- **Size**: Can be **finite** (e.g., all students enrolled in 2025) or **theoretically infinite** (e.g., all possible users of a system)
- **Example**: All Master's students in the Computer Science Department at University of Buea

**Sample:**

- **Definition**: A **subset** of the population that is actually selected and studied in the research
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Representative portion** of the population
  - Selected through **sampling methods** (random, stratified, convenience, etc.)
  - Used because studying the entire population is often **impractical, costly, or time-consuming**
- **Size**: **Smaller than the population** (though can be the same size if population is small)
- **Purpose**: To make **inferences about the population** based on sample data
- **Example**: 150 Master's students randomly selected from the Computer Science Department

**Key Distinctions:**

| Aspect | Population | Sample |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Size** | Entire group | Subset of population |
| **Study** | Usually not studied directly | Actually studied |
| **Purpose** | Target for generalization | Used to infer about population |
| **Feasibility** | Often impractical to study | Practical to study |
| **Representativeness** | Complete by definition | Should represent population |

**Important Note**: For research findings to be generalizable, the sample must be **representative** of the population. The method of sampling (random, stratified, etc.) affects how well the sample represents the population.

#### c) Explain the difference between convenience sampling and random sampling.

**Answer:**

**Convenience Sampling (Non-probability Sampling):**

- **Definition**: A sampling method where participants are selected based on their **availability, accessibility, or ease of recruitment**
- **Selection Process**: Researcher chooses participants who are **convenient to reach** or who volunteer
- **Probability**: **Non-probability sampling** - not every member of the population has a known or equal chance of being selected
- **Examples**:
  - Surveying students in your own class
  - Interviewing people in a shopping mall
  - Online surveys shared on social media (self-selection)
  - Studying colleagues or friends
- **Advantages**:
  - **Quick and inexpensive** to implement
  - **Easy to access** participants
  - Useful for **pilot studies** or exploratory research
  - Suitable when population is **homogeneous**
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **High risk of bias** - sample may not represent the population
  - **Low generalizability** - findings may not apply to the broader population
  - **Selection bias** - certain types of people more likely to be included
  - **Cannot estimate sampling error** statistically
  - **Limited external validity**

**Random Sampling (Probability Sampling):**

- **Definition**: A sampling method where **every member of the population has an equal and known chance** of being selected
- **Selection Process**: Uses **random selection procedures** (random number generators, lottery methods, systematic random sampling)
- **Probability**: **Probability sampling** - selection is based on chance, not researcher choice
- **Types**:
  - **Simple Random Sampling**: Each member has equal probability
  - **Systematic Random Sampling**: Every nth member selected after random start
  - **Stratified Random Sampling**: Population divided into strata, then random sampling within each
  - **Cluster Random Sampling**: Random selection of groups/clusters
- **Examples**:
  - Using a random number generator to select student IDs
  - Drawing names from a hat
  - Systematic selection (every 10th person on a list)
- **Advantages**:
  - **High representativeness** - sample likely to reflect population characteristics
  - **Reduced bias** - minimizes researcher selection bias
  - **Statistical validity** - allows for statistical inference and error estimation
  - **Generalizable results** - findings can be applied to the population
  - **Scientific rigor** - considered the gold standard for quantitative research
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **More time-consuming and costly** to implement
  - Requires **complete population list** (sampling frame)
  - May be **difficult to access** randomly selected participants
  - Some selected participants may **refuse to participate** (non-response bias)

**Key Differences Summary:**

| Aspect | Convenience Sampling | Random Sampling |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Selection Basis** | Availability/ease | Random chance |
| **Probability** | Non-probability | Probability |
| **Bias Risk** | High | Low |
| **Representativeness** | Low | High |
| **Generalizability** | Limited | High |
| **Cost/Time** | Low | High |
| **Statistical Validity** | Low | High |
| **Use Case** | Exploratory, pilot studies | Confirmatory, generalizable research |

**Best Practice**: For Master's level research, **random sampling** (or other probability methods) is generally preferred when the goal is to make inferences about a population. Convenience sampling should be used cautiously and its limitations clearly acknowledged in research reports.
