## Running the Code

### Java
```bash
# Compile
javac Shape.java

# Run
java ShapeTest
```

### Python
```bash
# Run
python shapes.py
```

---

## Inheritance Hierarchy

```
Shape (abstract)
├── Rectangle
│   └── Square
├── Triangle
└── Ellipse
    └── Circle
        └── Sector
```

---

## Shape Formulae

- **Triangle:** Area = 0.5 × base × height
- **Rectangle:** Area = width × height
- **Square:** Area = side²
- **Ellipse:** Area = π × a × b
- **Circle:** Area = π × r², Circumference = 2πr
- **Sector:** Area = 0.5 × r² × θ (θ in radians)

## IST603 Notes

1. All solutions follow object-oriented programming principles
2. Abstract classes use abstract methods where appropriate
3. Method overriding demonstrates polymorphism
4. Both Java and Python implementations are functionally equivalent
5. Code is well-commented and follows best practices for university-level programming

---

## Study Tips

### IST603 (Object-Oriented Programming)
1. Review the inheritance hierarchy to understand relationships
2. Practice implementing abstract classes and methods
3. Understand polymorphism and method overriding
4. Review exception handling in Java
5. Compare Java and Python implementations to see syntax differences

### IST605 (Human Information Processing)
1. Understand three stages of memory (duration, capacity, function)
2. Know serial position effects (primacy vs. recency)
3. Understand how delay affects recency but not primacy
4. Know three object recognition theories (template, feature, structural)
5. Understand Gestalt principles (proximity, closure, similarity)
6. Know memory functions (encoding, storage, retrieval)
7. Understand working memory components (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, etc.)
