### iii) Research Question Analysis (2 marks)

**Research Question:**
"Do final year OL GCE students who participate in a supplemental Mathematics tutorial programme learn more Mathematics as demonstrated in GCE OL results than those who do not participate in this supplementary Mathematics tutorial programme?"

#### iii-1) Independent Variable (1 mark)

**Answer:**
The independent variable is **participation in the supplemental Mathematics tutorial programme**.

**Explanation:**
- This is the variable that is **manipulated or selected** by the researcher
- The researcher creates two groups:
  - **Group 1:** Students who participate in the tutorial programme
  - **Group 2:** Students who do not participate in the tutorial programme
- This variable is the **presumed cause** that is expected to affect mathematics learning
- The researcher controls or selects which students are in which group
- It has two levels/categories: "participate" and "do not participate"

**Operational Definition:**
- **IV:** Participation status in supplemental Mathematics tutorial programme
- **Levels:** 
  - Level 1: Participates in tutorial programme
  - Level 2: Does not participate in tutorial programme

**Note:** This is a **categorical independent variable** (nominal: participate vs. not participate)

---

#### iii-2) Dependent Variable (1 mark)

**Answer:**
The dependent variable is **Mathematics learning as demonstrated in GCE OL results** (or simply **GCE OL Mathematics results/scores**).

**Explanation:**
- This is the variable that is **measured** to determine the effect of the independent variable
- It represents the **outcome** or result of interest
- It is the **presumed effect** that depends on participation in the tutorial programme
- The researcher measures this variable to see if there is a difference between the two groups
- It is measured after the intervention (tutorial programme)

**Operational Definition:**
- **DV:** GCE OL Mathematics examination scores/results
- **Measurement:** Scores obtained on the GCE OL Mathematics examination
- **Scale:** Likely measured as percentage scores or letter grades (quantitative or ordinal)

**Measurement Considerations:**
- Should be measured using standardized GCE OL Mathematics examination
- Scores should be comparable across both groups
- May be measured as:
  - Percentage scores (0-100%)
  - Letter grades (A, B, C, D, E, F)
  - Numerical scores

**Note:** This is a **quantitative dependent variable** (ratio or interval scale, depending on how scores are measured)

---

**Summary:**
- **IV:** Participation in supplemental Mathematics tutorial programme (categorical: yes/no)
- **DV:** GCE OL Mathematics results/scores (quantitative: examination scores)

**Research Design:**
- This is an **experimental or quasi-experimental design**
- Compares two groups: treatment group (participates) vs. control group (does not participate)
- Measures mathematics learning outcomes (GCE OL results) in both groups

## Part c) Factorial Experimental Design (6 marks)

### **Definition of Factorial Experimental Design**

**Factorial experimental design** is a research design that involves studying the effects of two or more independent variables (factors) simultaneously, along with their interaction effects. It allows researchers to examine not only the individual effects of each factor (main effects) but also how factors combine to influence the dependent variable (interaction effects).

**Key Concept:**
- Studies multiple independent variables at the same time
- Examines all possible combinations of factor levels
- More efficient than conducting separate experiments for each factor
- Allows detection of interaction effects

---

### **Variables in Factorial Design**

#### **1. Independent Variables (Factors)**

**Definition:**
In factorial design, independent variables are called **factors**. Each factor has two or more levels (values or conditions).

**Example:**
- **Factor A:** Teaching Method
  - Level 1: Traditional method
  - Level 2: Online method
- **Factor B:** Class Size
  - Level 1: Small class (20 students)
  - Level 2: Large class (40 students)

**Notation:**
- **2×2 Factorial Design:** 2 factors, each with 2 levels = 4 experimental conditions
- **2×3 Factorial Design:** 2 factors, one with 2 levels, one with 3 levels = 6 conditions
- **3×3 Factorial Design:** 2 factors, each with 3 levels = 9 conditions

**Number of Conditions:**
- Total conditions = (Levels of Factor A) × (Levels of Factor B) × ... × (Levels of Factor N)
- Example: 2×2 = 4 conditions; 2×3 = 6 conditions; 3×3 = 9 conditions

---

#### **2. Dependent Variable**

**Definition:**
The dependent variable is the outcome variable that is measured to assess the effects of the factors.

**Example:**
- Student performance (test scores)
- Learning outcomes
- Achievement scores

---

### **Main Effects**

**Definition:**
**Main effects** are the individual effects of each independent variable (factor) on the dependent variable, averaged across all levels of the other factors.

**Characteristics:**
- Examines the effect of one factor while ignoring the other factors
- Answers: "Does Factor A affect the dependent variable?"
- Answers: "Does Factor B affect the dependent variable?"
- Averaged across all conditions of the other factor

**Example (2×2 Factorial Design):**

**Factor A: Teaching Method (Traditional vs. Online)**
**Factor B: Class Size (Small vs. Large)**
**DV: Test Scores**

**Main Effect of Teaching Method:**
- Compare: Average of (Traditional-Small + Traditional-Large) vs. Average of (Online-Small + Online-Large)
- Answers: "Does teaching method affect test scores, regardless of class size?"

**Main Effect of Class Size:**
- Compare: Average of (Traditional-Small + Online-Small) vs. Average of (Traditional-Large + Online-Large)
- Answers: "Does class size affect test scores, regardless of teaching method?"

**Interpretation:**
- **Significant Main Effect:** The factor has a significant effect on the dependent variable
- **Non-significant Main Effect:** The factor does not significantly affect the dependent variable

---

### **Interaction Effects**

**Definition:**
**Interaction effects** occur when the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on the level of another independent variable. In other words, the factors combine in a way that produces an effect that is different from the sum of their individual effects.

**Characteristics:**
- Examines how factors work together
- Answers: "Does the effect of Factor A depend on the level of Factor B?"
- Indicates that factors are not independent in their effects
- The effect of one factor is different at different levels of the other factor

**Example (2×2 Factorial Design):**

**Interaction Effect:**
- "Does the effect of teaching method depend on class size?"
- "Does the effect of class size depend on teaching method?"

**Possible Scenarios:**

**1. No Interaction (Additive):**
- Effect of teaching method is the same regardless of class size
- Effect of class size is the same regardless of teaching method
- Factors work independently

**2. Interaction Present (Non-additive):**
- Online method works better in small classes but not in large classes
- Traditional method works better in large classes
- The best combination is Online-Small class
- Factors work together (synergistic or antagonistic)

**Graphical Representation:**
- **No Interaction:** Lines on graph are parallel
- **Interaction:** Lines on graph cross or are not parallel

**Interpretation:**
- **Significant Interaction:** The effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor
- **Non-significant Interaction:** Factors work independently (additive effects)

---

### **Advantages of Factorial Design**

1. **Efficiency:** Study multiple factors in one experiment
2. **Interaction Detection:** Can detect interaction effects
3. **Generalizability:** Results apply across different levels of factors
4. **Economy:** More information from same number of participants
5. **Comprehensive:** Provides complete picture of factor effects

---

### **Example: Complete Factorial Design**

**2×2 Factorial Design:**

**Factor A: Teaching Method**
- Level 1: Traditional
- Level 2: Online

**Factor B: Class Size**
- Level 1: Small (20 students)
- Level 2: Large (40 students)

**Experimental Conditions:**
1. Traditional + Small class
2. Traditional + Large class
3. Online + Small class
4. Online + Large class

**Analysis:**
- **Main Effect A:** Teaching Method effect (averaged across class sizes)
- **Main Effect B:** Class Size effect (averaged across teaching methods)
- **Interaction A×B:** Does teaching method effect depend on class size?

**Possible Results:**
- Online method better than traditional (Main Effect A)
- Small class better than large class (Main Effect B)
- Online method much better in small classes, but similar in large classes (Interaction)

---

### **Summary**

**Factorial Experimental Design:**
- Studies **multiple independent variables (factors)** simultaneously
- Examines **main effects** (individual factor effects)
- Examines **interaction effects** (how factors combine)
- More efficient and comprehensive than single-factor designs
- Allows detection of complex relationships between variables
