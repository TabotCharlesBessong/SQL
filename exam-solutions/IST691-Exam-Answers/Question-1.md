- To establish cause-and-effect relationships
- To make predictions and forecasts

**Method:**
- Structured and standardized approach
- Pre-determined research design
- Controlled experimental conditions
- Large sample sizes for statistical power
- Systematic data collection procedures
- Replicable methodology

**Data Sources:**

### **Qualitative Research**

**Definition:**
Qualitative research is an exploratory approach that seeks to understand human behavior, experiences, meanings, and social phenomena through non-numerical data such as words, images, and observations.

**Purpose:**
- To understand social phenomena and human behavior
- To explore meanings and interpretations
- To develop theories and concepts
- To understand context and complexity
- To gain deep insights into experiences
- To understand "why" and "how" rather than "how much"

**Method:**
- Flexible and adaptive approach
- Emergent research design
- Naturalistic settings (real-world contexts)
- Smaller sample sizes (but rich, detailed data)
- Open-ended data collection
- Researcher as instrument (subjective interpretation)

**Data Sources:**
- Interviews (semi-structured or unstructured)
- Focus groups
- Observations (participant or non-participant)
- Documents and texts
- Case studies
- Diaries and journals
- Audio/video recordings
- Field notes

**Data Analysis:**
- Thematic analysis
- Content analysis
- Narrative analysis
- Discourse analysis
- Grounded theory
- Coding and categorization
- Interpretation and meaning-making
- Identification of patterns and themes

**Examples:**
- Interview study on student experiences with online learning
- Case study of a successful startup company
- Ethnographic study of a cultural group
- Focus group discussion on healthcare perceptions

## Part b) Experimental Research vs Descriptive Research (4 marks)

### **Experimental Research**

**Definition:**
Experimental research is a scientific approach where the researcher actively manipulates one or more independent variables to observe their effect on dependent variables, while controlling for extraneous variables through randomization and control groups.

**Purpose:**
- To establish cause-and-effect relationships
- To test hypotheses about causal relationships
- To determine if a treatment/intervention causes specific outcomes
- To control and manipulate variables systematically
- To make causal inferences with high confidence

**Method:**
- **Manipulation:** Researcher actively changes the independent variable
- **Control:** Use of control groups that don't receive treatment
- **Randomization:** Random assignment of participants to groups
- **Comparison:** Comparison between treatment and control groups
- **Experimental conditions:** Controlled environment/settings
- **Pre-test and post-test measurements**

**Data Sources:**
- Controlled experiments and trials
- Laboratory settings (typically)
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Field experiments
- Quasi-experimental designs
- Pre-test and post-test measurements
- Treatment and control group data

**Data Analysis:**
- Statistical comparison of groups (t-tests, ANOVA)
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
- Regression analysis
- Effect size calculations
- Statistical significance testing
- Comparison of means between groups
- Control for confounding variables

**Key Characteristics:**
- High control over variables
- Can establish causality
- Requires manipulation of variables
- Often uses random assignment
- May have ethical constraints
- Strong internal validity

**Examples:**
- Testing effectiveness of a new teaching method (experimental group vs. control group)
- Drug trial comparing new medication to placebo
- Study on impact of exercise on weight loss (random assignment to exercise/no exercise)
- Laboratory experiment on memory recall under different conditions

### **Descriptive Research**

**Definition:**
Descriptive research describes characteristics of a population or phenomenon without manipulating variables or establishing causal relationships. It aims to answer "what is" rather than "what causes."

**Purpose:**
- To describe characteristics of a population or phenomenon
- To document current conditions and status
- To identify patterns and trends
- To provide a snapshot of a situation
- To gather baseline information
- To answer "what," "who," "where," and "when" questions

**Method:**
- **No manipulation:** Variables are observed as they naturally occur
- **No intervention:** Researcher does not intervene or change conditions
- **Observation:** Systematic observation and documentation
- **Surveys:** Collection of data about current status
- **Case studies:** In-depth examination of specific cases
- **Cross-sectional studies:** Data collected at one point in time

**Data Sources:**
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Observations (natural settings)
- Case studies
- Census data
- Existing records and documents
- Interviews
- Archival data
- Longitudinal studies (trends over time)

**Data Analysis:**
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, frequency)
- Frequency distributions
- Percentages and proportions
- Cross-tabulations
- Charts and graphs
- Correlation analysis (relationship, not causation)
- Trend analysis

**Key Characteristics:**
- No manipulation of variables
- Describes "what is" rather than "what causes"
- Natural settings
- Can use large samples
- Provides baseline information
- Weak or no causal inference

**Examples:**
- Survey on student satisfaction with university facilities
- Census data describing population demographics
- Case study describing a successful organization
- Observational study documenting classroom behavior patterns
- Market research describing consumer preferences

### **Key Differences Summary**

| Dimension | Experimental Research | Descriptive Research |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Establish cause-effect relationships | Describe characteristics and patterns |
| **Manipulation** | Yes - researcher manipulates variables | No - observes variables as they occur |
| **Control** | High control, uses control groups | Minimal control, natural settings |
| **Variables** | Independent variable is manipulated | Variables are observed/measured only |
| **Causality** | Can establish causal relationships | Cannot establish causality (only associations) |
| **Setting** | Controlled (often laboratory) | Natural settings |
| **Randomization** | Typically uses random assignment | May or may not use random sampling |
| **Hypothesis** | Tests hypotheses about causes | Describes current state (may generate hypotheses) |
| **Internal Validity** | High (controlled conditions) | Lower (natural conditions, confounding variables) |
| **External Validity** | May be lower (artificial conditions) | Higher (real-world settings) |
| **Time** | Can be prospective or retrospective | Often cross-sectional (one point in time) |

### **Additional Context**

**Quasi-Experimental Research:**
- A middle ground between experimental and descriptive
- Lacks full randomization but has manipulation
- Used when true experiments are not feasible

**Correlational Research:**
- A type of descriptive research
- Examines relationships between variables
- Cannot establish causation, only association

**Key Takeaway:**
- **Experimental research** = manipulation + control = causality
- **Descriptive research** = observation + documentation = description
