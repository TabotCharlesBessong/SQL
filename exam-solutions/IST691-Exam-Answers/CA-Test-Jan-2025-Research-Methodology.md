## Question 1: Research Questions and Variables (6 marks)

### a) State what is meant by the research question. (1 mark)

**Answer:**

A **research question** is a clear, focused, and specific inquiry that defines what a researcher wants to investigate or understand. It guides the entire research process by:

- Identifying the problem or phenomenon to be studied
- Determining the scope and direction of the research
- Shaping the methodology and data collection approach
- Providing a framework for analyzing and interpreting results

**Key Characteristics:**
- Must be answerable through empirical investigation
- Should be specific and well-defined
- Must be relevant to the field of study
- Should be feasible to investigate within available resources

---

### b) Examine the following research question: "Do Form Five students who participate in a supplemental daily mathematics tutorial program learn more mathematics as demonstrated in the mathematics mock GCE results than those who do not receive this supplementary mathematics tutorial program?" (2 marks)

#### i) What is the independent variable?

**Answer:**

The **independent variable** is: **Participation in the supplemental daily mathematics tutorial program** (or **Tutorial Program Participation**).

**Explanation:**
- The independent variable is the factor that is **manipulated** or **controlled** by the researcher
- In this study, students are either in the group that receives the tutorial program or the group that does not
- This variable has two levels/categories:
  - **Level 1:** Students who participate in the tutorial program
  - **Level 2:** Students who do not participate in the tutorial program

---

#### ii) What is the dependent variable?

**Answer:**

The **dependent variable** is: **Mathematics learning** (as measured by **mathematics mock GCE results**).

**Explanation:**
- The dependent variable is the **outcome** or **effect** that is being measured
- It is what the researcher expects to change or differ based on the independent variable
- In this case, mathematics learning is measured through the **mathematics mock GCE results** (scores/performance)
- The researcher is investigating whether tutorial program participation affects mathematics learning outcomes

**Variable Relationship:**
```
Independent Variable → Dependent Variable
Tutorial Program Participation → Mathematics Learning (GCE Results)
```

### c) In a large study of historical data that was collected over the past 10 years, the following results were arrived at: (4 marks)

- There was greater incidence of diabetes in people with high blood sugar levels than in people with low blood sugar levels
- No relationship was found in people's heights and the time they spent reading
- People with high stress levels had lower levels of alertness than people with low stress level

#### i) State the kind of research that was involved in the study. (1 mark)

**Answer:**

The kind of research involved is: **Correlational Research** (or **Observational Research** / **Non-experimental Research**).

**Explanation:**
- The study used **historical data** collected over the past 10 years
- The researchers **observed** and **analyzed** existing relationships between variables
- No manipulation of variables occurred - the researchers did not control or assign participants to conditions
- The study examined **associations** or **relationships** between variables without intervention
- This is characteristic of **correlational/observational research** rather than experimental research

**Alternative acceptable answers:**
- **Retrospective Research** (since it uses historical data)
- **Archival Research** (if data came from existing records)
- **Longitudinal Research** (if data was collected over time from the same participants)

---

#### ii) Write one sentence or phrase that summarizes each of the three results that are outlined above. (1.5 marks)

**Answer:**

1. **Result 1:** "High blood sugar levels are positively associated with increased diabetes incidence" or "People with high blood sugar have higher rates of diabetes."

2. **Result 2:** "Height and reading time are not correlated" or "There is no relationship between height and reading time."

3. **Result 3:** "High stress levels are negatively associated with alertness" or "People with high stress have lower alertness levels."

---

#### iii) For each of the three results, indicate if causation was established; if causation was not established, state why. (1.5 marks)

**Answer:**

**Result 1: High blood sugar levels and diabetes incidence**

**Causation:** **NOT established**

**Reason:**
- This is a **correlational relationship** - the study only shows an association, not causation
- **Third variable problem:** Other factors (genetics, diet, exercise, age) could be causing both high blood sugar and diabetes
- **Directionality problem:** It's unclear if high blood sugar causes diabetes or if diabetes causes high blood sugar, or if both are caused by another factor
- **Reverse causation:** Diabetes might cause high blood sugar rather than the other way around
- To establish causation, an **experimental study** would be needed where blood sugar levels are manipulated

---

**Result 2: Height and reading time**

**Causation:** **NOT established** (and no relationship was found)

**Reason:**
- No relationship was found, so there is nothing to establish causation for
- Even if a relationship existed, causation could not be established from correlational data
- Height is largely determined by genetics and cannot be manipulated, making causal inference difficult
- The lack of relationship suggests these variables are independent of each other

---

**Result 3: High stress levels and alertness**

**Causation:** **NOT established**

**Reason:**
- This is a **correlational relationship** - the study only shows an association
- **Third variable problem:** Other factors (sleep quality, workload, health conditions, caffeine intake) could affect both stress and alertness
- **Bidirectional relationship:** Stress might reduce alertness, but low alertness might also increase stress
- **Confounding variables:** Factors like work environment, personal circumstances, or health issues could be influencing both variables
- To establish causation, an **experimental study** would be needed where stress levels are manipulated and other variables are controlled

---

**General Principle:**

**Correlational research CANNOT establish causation** because:
1. **No manipulation:** Variables are not controlled or manipulated by the researcher
2. **Third variable problem:** Unmeasured variables may be causing the observed relationship
3. **Directionality problem:** The direction of causality is unclear
4. **Confounding variables:** Other factors may influence both variables

**To establish causation, experimental research is required:**
- Random assignment to groups
- Manipulation of the independent variable
- Control of extraneous variables
- Randomization to minimize confounding

## Question 2: Research Types and Survey Methods (9 marks)

### a) Explain briefly, the difference between descriptive research and experimental research. (2 marks)

**Answer:**

**Descriptive Research:**
- **Purpose:** To describe, observe, and document characteristics, behaviors, or phenomena **as they naturally occur**
- **Method:** Researchers **observe** and **measure** variables without manipulating or controlling them
- **Variables:** No manipulation of independent variables; researchers simply observe and record
- **Causation:** **Cannot establish causation** - only describes relationships or patterns
- **Control:** Minimal control over variables or environment
- **Examples:** Surveys, case studies, observational studies, correlational studies

**Experimental Research:**
- **Purpose:** To determine **cause-and-effect relationships** by manipulating variables and observing outcomes
- **Method:** Researchers **manipulate** the independent variable and **control** other variables to observe effects on the dependent variable
- **Variables:** Independent variable is **manipulated** (e.g., treatment vs. control group); dependent variable is **measured**
- **Causation:** **Can establish causation** through controlled manipulation and random assignment
- **Control:** High level of control over variables, environment, and extraneous factors
- **Examples:** Randomized controlled trials, laboratory experiments, field experiments

**Key Differences Summary:**

| Aspect | Descriptive Research | Experimental Research |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Manipulation** | No manipulation | Variables are manipulated |
| **Control** | Minimal control | High control |
| **Causation** | Cannot establish | Can establish |
| **Purpose** | Describe/observe | Test cause-effect |
| **Design** | Observational | Controlled intervention |

### b) Answer the following questions in relation to survey research: (7 marks)

#### i) Briefly describe the following two categories of questions: Open-ended questions and Close-ended questions. (3 marks)

**Answer:**

**Open-ended Questions:**

**Description:**
- Questions that allow respondents to answer **in their own words** without predetermined response options
- Respondents have **freedom** to express their thoughts, opinions, or experiences in detail
- No fixed set of answer choices is provided

**Characteristics:**
- Require qualitative analysis
- Produce rich, detailed responses
- Allow for unexpected insights
- More time-consuming to answer and analyze
- Require coding or thematic analysis

**Examples:**
- "What factors influence your decision to purchase a smartphone?"
- "How would you describe your experience with online learning?"
- "What improvements would you suggest for the university library?"

**Advantages:**
- Capture detailed, nuanced responses
- Allow respondents to express unique perspectives
- Can reveal unexpected information
- Provide context and depth

**Disadvantages:**
- More difficult and time-consuming to analyze
- May produce irrelevant or off-topic responses
- Require more effort from respondents
- Cannot be easily quantified or compared

---

**Close-ended Questions:**

**Description:**
- Questions that provide **predetermined response options** from which respondents must choose
- Respondents select from a **fixed set of answers** (e.g., yes/no, multiple choice, rating scales)
- Answers are **structured** and **standardized**

**Characteristics:**
- Easy to quantify and analyze statistically
- Quick to answer
- Produce comparable data across respondents
- Limited to provided options
- May not capture all nuances

**Types:**
- **Yes/No questions:** "Do you own a smartphone? (Yes/No)"

- **Rating scales:** "Rate your satisfaction from 1-5"
- **Likert scales:** "Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree"

**Examples:**
- "How often do you use social media? (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Never)"
- "Rate your satisfaction with the course: (1-5 scale)"
- "Which operating system do you prefer? (Windows/Mac/Linux)"

**Advantages:**
- Easy to analyze and quantify
- Quick to complete
- Standardized responses for comparison
- Can be administered to large samples efficiently
- Suitable for statistical analysis

**Disadvantages:**
- May not capture all possible responses
- Can force respondents into categories that don't fit
- May miss important nuances or details
- Limited depth of information

#### ii) Distinguish between population and sample. (2 marks)

**Answer:**

**Population:**

**Definition:**
- The **entire group** of individuals, objects, or events that a researcher wants to study
- The **complete set** of all members that share a common characteristic of interest
- The **target group** about which the researcher wants to draw conclusions

**Characteristics:**
- Includes **all** members of the group of interest
- Often **too large** to study in its entirety
- Defined by specific criteria (e.g., all Form Five students in Cameroon, all smartphone users in Buea)

**Examples:**
- All students enrolled at University of Buea
- All registered voters in Cameroon
- All employees of a specific company
- All patients with diabetes in a hospital

---

**Sample:**

**Definition:**
- A **subset** or **portion** of the population that is actually studied
- A **representative group** selected from the population
- The **actual participants** from whom data is collected

**Characteristics:**
- A **smaller, manageable group** selected from the population
- Should be **representative** of the population to allow generalization
- Used because studying the entire population is often impractical or impossible
- The size and selection method determine how well it represents the population

**Examples:**
- 200 students randomly selected from University of Buea
- 500 voters selected from all registered voters in Cameroon
- 50 employees selected from a company
- 100 patients selected from all diabetes patients in a hospital

---

**Key Distinction:**

| Aspect | Population | Sample |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Size** | Entire group (often very large) | Subset (smaller, manageable) |
| **Scope** | All members with the characteristic | Selected members from population |
| **Purpose** | Target group for conclusions | Group actually studied |
| **Feasibility** | Often too large to study | Practical to study |
| **Generalization** | Conclusions apply to population | Results generalized to population |

**Relationship:**
```
Population (All members)
    ↓
    ↓ [Sampling]
    ↓
Sample (Selected members)
    ↓
    ↓ [Data Collection & Analysis]
    ↓
Generalization back to Population
```

**Important Note:**
- The goal of sampling is to select a **representative sample** that accurately reflects the population
- **Sampling bias** occurs when the sample is not representative, leading to incorrect conclusions
- **Random sampling** helps ensure representativeness

---

#### iii) What is the difference between convenience sampling and random sampling? (2 marks)

**Answer:**

**Convenience Sampling:**

**Definition:**
- A **non-probability sampling** method where participants are selected based on their **availability** and **accessibility**
- Researchers choose participants who are **easy to reach** or **willing to participate**
- Selection is based on **convenience** rather than random selection

**Characteristics:**
- **No random selection** - participants are chosen based on ease of access
- **Quick and inexpensive** to implement
- **No guarantee of representativeness**
- Participants are selected because they are **convenient** (e.g., nearby, available, willing)

**Examples:**
- Surveying students in your own class
- Interviewing people in a shopping mall
- Using volunteers who respond to an advertisement
- Surveying friends, family, or colleagues
- Online surveys where anyone can participate

**Advantages:**
- **Fast and easy** to implement
- **Low cost** - requires minimal resources
- **Useful for pilot studies** or exploratory research
- **Accessible** when other methods are difficult

**Disadvantages:**
- **High risk of bias** - not representative of population
- **Cannot generalize** results to the population
- **Self-selection bias** - only certain types of people participate
- **Limited external validity** - results may not apply beyond the sample

---

**Random Sampling:**

**Definition:**
- A **probability sampling** method where **every member** of the population has an **equal chance** of being selected
- Selection is based on **random chance** using randomization techniques
- Each member has a **known, non-zero probability** of selection

**Characteristics:**
- **Random selection** ensures no systematic bias
- **Equal probability** for all population members
- Uses **randomization techniques** (random number generators, lottery methods, etc.)
- **Representative** of the population when done correctly

**Types:**
- **Simple Random Sampling:** Each member has equal chance (e.g., drawing names from a hat)
- **Stratified Random Sampling:** Population divided into strata, then random sampling within each
- **Cluster Random Sampling:** Random selection of groups, then all members in selected groups
- **Systematic Random Sampling:** Selecting every nth member after random start

**Examples:**
- Using a random number generator to select student IDs from a complete list
- Drawing names from a hat containing all population members
- Using a computer program to randomly select participants from a database
- Systematic selection (e.g., every 10th person from a list starting at random point)

**Advantages:**
- **Representative** of the population
- **Reduces bias** through random selection
- **Allows generalization** to the population
- **Statistical validity** - can use inferential statistics
- **High external validity**

**Disadvantages:**
- **More time-consuming** and expensive
- Requires **complete population list** (sampling frame)
- May be **difficult to implement** in some situations
- **Not always feasible** for large or dispersed populations

---

**Key Differences Summary:**

| Aspect | Convenience Sampling | Random Sampling |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Selection Method** | Based on availability/ease | Based on random chance |
| **Probability** | Non-probability sampling | Probability sampling |
| **Representativeness** | Not guaranteed | Representative when done correctly |
| **Bias** | High risk of bias | Low risk of bias |
| **Generalization** | Cannot generalize | Can generalize to population |
| **Cost & Time** | Quick and inexpensive | More time-consuming and costly |
| **Validity** | Low external validity | High external validity |
| **Use Cases** | Exploratory research, pilot studies | Main research, when generalization needed |

**Example Comparison:**

**Convenience Sampling:**
- Researcher stands outside a university library and surveys the first 50 students who pass by
- Selection is based on who happens to be there at that time

**Random Sampling:**
- Researcher obtains a complete list of all university students
- Uses a random number generator to select 50 student IDs
- Contacts those specific students for the survey
