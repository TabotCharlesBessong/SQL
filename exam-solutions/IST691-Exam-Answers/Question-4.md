- **Clear and Specific:** Clearly states what is being investigated
- **Focused:** Narrow enough to be answerable within the scope of the study
- **Researchable:** Can be investigated through empirical research
- **Significant:** Addresses an important issue or problem

**Examples:**
- "What is the effect of online learning on student academic performance?"
- "How do teaching methods influence student engagement in mathematics?"
- "What factors contribute to employee job satisfaction?"

## Part b) Empirical Rule (3 marks)

### **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)**

**Definition:**
The **Empirical Rule** (also called the **68-95-99.7 Rule** or **Three-Sigma Rule**) states that for a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve), approximately:
- **68%** of data falls within **1 standard deviation** of the mean (μ ± 1σ)
- **95%** of data falls within **2 standard deviations** of the mean (μ ± 2σ)
- **99.7%** of data falls within **3 standard deviations** of the mean (μ ± 3σ)

**Visual Representation (Normal Curve):**

```
                   34%          34%
               13.5%        13.5%
           2.35%        2.35%
       0.15%        0.15%
       |            |            |            |            |            |            |
    μ-3σ        μ-2σ        μ-1σ         μ         μ+1σ        μ+2σ        μ+3σ
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**Within 1 Standard Deviation (μ ± 1σ):**
- **68%** of data falls in this range
- **34%** between μ and μ+1σ
- **34%** between μ and μ-1σ
- Most common values

**Within 2 Standard Deviations (μ ± 2σ):**
- **95%** of data falls in this range
- **68%** (from above) + **13.5%** between μ+1σ and μ+2σ + **13.5%** between μ-1σ and μ-2σ
- Covers most of the data

**Within 3 Standard Deviations (μ ± 3σ):**
- **99.7%** of data falls in this range
- **95%** (from above) + **2.35%** between μ+2σ and μ+3σ + **2.35%** between μ-2σ and μ-3σ
- Covers almost all data

**Beyond 3 Standard Deviations:**
- **0.3%** of data falls beyond μ ± 3σ
- **0.15%** beyond μ+3σ
- **0.15%** beyond μ-3σ
- Very rare/extreme values

**Key Points:**
- Applies only to **normal distributions** (bell-shaped curves)

## Part c) Significance Level and Hypothesis Testing (8 marks)

### (i) Role of Significance Level (α) in Hypothesis Testing (2 marks)

**Definition:**
The **significance level** (denoted by **α**, alpha) is the probability threshold used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. It represents the maximum probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) that the researcher is willing to accept.

**Key Concept:**
- **Probability Threshold:** Maximum acceptable probability of Type I error
- **Decision Criterion:** Used to decide whether results are statistically significant
- **Common Values:** Typically set at 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), or 0.10 (10%)
- **Risk Level:** Level of risk researcher is willing to take

**Role in Hypothesis Testing:**

**1. Decision Criterion (0.5 marks)**
- **Cutoff Point:** Provides cutoff point for deciding statistical significance
- **Comparison:** p-value is compared to α to make decision
- **Rule:** If p-value < α, reject H₀; if p-value ≥ α, fail to reject H₀
- **Binary Decision:** Creates clear decision rule

**2. Type I Error Control (0.5 marks)**
- **Error Rate:** Controls the probability of Type I error
- **False Positive:** Limits false positive results (rejecting true H₀)
- **Risk Management:** Researcher sets acceptable risk level
- **Protection:** Protects against claiming effects that don't exist

**3. Statistical Significance Determination (0.5 marks)**
- **Significance:** Determines what constitutes "statistically significant" results
- **Threshold:** Sets threshold for significance
- **Interpretation:** Guides interpretation of statistical results
- **Standard:** Provides standard for scientific reporting

**4. Balance Between Errors (0.5 marks)**
- **Trade-off:** Balances Type I and Type II errors
- **Lower α:** Lower α reduces Type I errors but increases Type II errors
- **Higher α:** Higher α increases Type I errors but reduces Type II errors
- **Decision:** Researcher must choose appropriate balance

**Common Significance Levels:**
- **α = 0.05 (5%):** Most common, standard in many fields
- **α = 0.01 (1%):** More stringent, used when Type I error is very costly
- **α = 0.10 (10%):** Less stringent, used in exploratory research

**Example:**
- **α = 0.05:** Willing to accept 5% chance of Type I error
- **If p-value = 0.03:** Since 0.03 < 0.05, reject H₀ (statistically significant)
- **If p-value = 0.08:** Since 0.08 > 0.05, fail to reject H₀ (not statistically significant)

- Fail to reject H₀ if z ≤ +1.645

---

#### **Two-Tailed Test**

**Hypothesis:**
- H₀: μ = μ₀
- H₁: μ ≠ μ₀

**Critical Region:**
- **Both tails** of the distribution
- **Area = α/2 = 0.025** in each tail (total α = 0.05)
- **Critical values:** z = -1.96 and z = +1.96 (for α = 0.05, two-tailed)

**Normal Curve Sketch:**
```
       2.5% (α/2)          95% (Fail to reject H₀)          2.5% (α/2)
    (Reject H₀)                                            (Reject H₀)
       |                                                         |
       |                                                         |
    -1.96                                                      +1.96
    (z-critical)                                            (z-critical)
                    |
                    0
```

**Shaded Areas:**
- **Both tails** are shaded (2.5% in each tail, total 5%)
- Represents rejection regions
- If test statistic falls in either region, reject H₀

**Interpretation:**
- Reject H₀ if z < -1.96 OR z > +1.96
- Fail to reject H₀ if -1.96 ≤ z ≤ +1.96

**Key Difference:**
- Two-tailed test splits α between two tails (α/2 in each)
- One-tailed test puts all α in one tail
- Two-tailed is more conservative (harder to reject H₀)

---

**Summary Table:**

| Test Type | Critical Region | Critical Values (α=0.05) | Shaded Area |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Left-Tailed** | Left tail only | z = -1.645 | 5% left tail |
| **Right-Tailed** | Right tail only | z = +1.645 | 5% right tail |
| **Two-Tailed** | Both tails | z = -1.96 and z = +1.96 | 2.5% each tail (5% total) |

## Part d) ANOVA: Purpose and Types (5 marks)

### **Purpose of ANOVA**

**Definition:**
**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** is a statistical method used to test whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more groups. It determines if the variation between groups is significantly greater than the variation within groups.

**Main Purpose:**
- **Compare Multiple Means:** Test differences among three or more group means simultaneously
- **Efficiency:** More efficient than conducting multiple t-tests
- **Type I Error Control:** Controls overall Type I error rate (avoids multiple comparison problem)
- **F-Test:** Uses F-statistic to test for significant differences

**Key Questions ANOVA Answers:**
- Are there significant differences between group means?
- Is the variation between groups greater than variation within groups?
- Which groups differ from each other? (requires post-hoc tests)

**When to Use ANOVA:**
- Comparing means of 3 or more groups
- One or more categorical independent variables
- One continuous dependent variable
- Assumptions: normality, homogeneity of variance, independence

**Advantages:**
- **Efficiency:** One test instead of multiple t-tests
- **Error Control:** Controls overall Type I error rate
- **Flexibility:** Can handle multiple factors and interactions
- **Power:** Generally more powerful than multiple t-tests

---

### **One-Way ANOVA**

**Definition:**
**One-way ANOVA** is an ANOVA design with **one independent variable (factor)** that has **three or more levels (groups)**. It tests whether there are significant differences among the means of these groups.

**Structure:**
- **1 Independent Variable (Factor):** One categorical variable
- **3+ Levels/Groups:** Three or more groups to compare
- **1 Dependent Variable:** One continuous outcome variable

**Example:**
- **IV:** Teaching Method (3 levels: Traditional, Online, Hybrid)
- **DV:** Student Test Scores
- **Question:** Do test scores differ significantly among the three teaching methods?

**Hypotheses:**
- **H₀:** μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃ (all group means are equal)
- **H₁:** At least one group mean is different

**Analysis:**
- Compares variation **between groups** to variation **within groups**
- **F-ratio = Between-groups variance / Within-groups variance**
- If F is large, groups differ significantly

**When to Use:**
- Single factor with multiple levels
- Comparing 3+ groups
- Simple experimental designs

---

### **Two-Way ANOVA**

**Definition:**
**Two-way ANOVA** is an ANOVA design with **two independent variables (factors)**. It tests for main effects of each factor and interaction effects between the two factors.

**Structure:**
- **2 Independent Variables (Factors):** Two categorical variables
- **Multiple Levels:** Each factor can have 2+ levels
- **1 Dependent Variable:** One continuous outcome variable

**Example:**
- **Factor A:** Teaching Method (2 levels: Traditional, Online)
- **Factor B:** Class Size (2 levels: Small, Large)
- **DV:** Student Test Scores
- **Questions:**
  - Does teaching method affect test scores? (Main effect A)
  - Does class size affect test scores? (Main effect B)
  - Does the effect of teaching method depend on class size? (Interaction A×B)

**What Two-Way ANOVA Tests:**

**1. Main Effect of Factor A:**
- Effect of first factor, averaged across levels of second factor
- Answers: "Does Factor A affect the DV?"

**2. Main Effect of Factor B:**
- Effect of second factor, averaged across levels of first factor
- Answers: "Does Factor B affect the DV?"

**3. Interaction Effect (A×B):**
- Combined effect of both factors
- Answers: "Does the effect of Factor A depend on Factor B?"
- Indicates whether factors work together or independently

**Example Results:**
- **Main Effect A:** Online method better than traditional (averaged across class sizes)
- **Main Effect B:** Small classes better than large classes (averaged across methods)
- **Interaction:** Online method much better in small classes, but similar in large classes

**When to Use:**
- Two factors of interest
- Want to test interactions
- More complex experimental designs
- Factorial experimental designs

### **Key Differences**

| Aspect | One-Way ANOVA | Two-Way ANOVA |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Number of Factors** | 1 independent variable | 2 independent variables |
| **What It Tests** | Differences among groups | Main effects + interactions |
| **Complexity** | Simpler | More complex |
| **Information** | Group differences only | Group differences + interactions |
| **Design** | Single-factor design | Factorial design |
| **F-Tests** | 1 F-test | 3 F-tests (A, B, A×B) |

**Summary:**
- **One-Way ANOVA:** One factor, tests group differences
- **Two-Way ANOVA:** Two factors, tests main effects and interactions

## Part e) Factory Shift Study - ANOVA Application (4 marks)

### **Study Context**

**Scenario:**
- Factory manufactures machine parts with specific dimensions
- Three work shifts (Shift 1, Shift 2, Shift 3)
- Research question: Does shift affect the dimension of machine parts?
- One-way ANOVA used for analysis

**Data Summary:**
- **Shift 1:** Mean = 4.147 (15 observations)
- **Shift 2:** Mean = 4.148 (15 observations)
- **Shift 3:** Mean = 4.151 (15 observations)
- **Total:** 45 observations (15 per shift)

---

### (i) Hypotheses for the Study (2 marks)

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**
There is no significant difference in the mean dimension of machine parts among the three shifts.

**Mathematical Form:**
H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ = μ₃

Where:
- μ₁ = population mean dimension for Shift 1
- μ₂ = population mean dimension for Shift 2
- μ₃ = population mean dimension for Shift 3

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**
There is a significant difference in the mean dimension of machine parts among at least two of the three shifts.

**Mathematical Form:**
H₁: At least one μᵢ ≠ μⱼ (where i ≠ j, and i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3})

Or more simply:
H₁: Not all shift means are equal

**Interpretation:**
- **H₀:** All three shifts produce parts with the same mean dimension (no shift effect)
- **H₁:** At least one shift produces parts with a different mean dimension (shift has an effect)

**Note:** This is a **non-directional (two-tailed) hypothesis** because we're testing for any difference, not a specific direction.

---

### (ii) Critical Value and Conclusion (2 marks)

#### (ii-1) Critical F-Value (1 mark)

**Given Information:**
- **Between-groups degrees of freedom:** df₁ = 2 (3 groups - 1 = 2)
- **Within-groups degrees of freedom:** df₂ = 39 (as stated, though typically would be 42 for 45 total observations with 3 groups: 45 - 3 = 42)
- **Significance level:** α = 0.10 (for two-tailed test)
- **Test type:** Two-tailed (testing for any difference)

**Using F-Table:**
- Look up F-table for **α = 0.10 (two-tailed test)**
- **Numerator df (df₁):** 2
- **Denominator df (df₂):** 39

**From the F-table provided:**
- For df₁ = 2 and df₂ = 39, at α = 0.10 (two-tailed):
- **Critical F-value = 3.24**

**Answer:**
The critical F-value at α = 0.10 (two-tailed) with df₁ = 2 and df₂ = 39 is **F = 3.24**.

**Interpretation:**
- If calculated F-statistic > 3.24, reject H₀ (significant difference)
- If calculated F-statistic ≤ 3.24, fail to reject H₀ (no significant difference)

---

#### (ii-2) Conclusion if F < Critical Value (1 mark)

**Scenario:**
If the ANOVA analysis results in an F-value that is **smaller than the critical value (3.24)**, the conclusion would be:

**Conclusion:**
**Fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀).**

**Interpretation:**
- There is **no statistically significant difference** in the mean dimension of machine parts among the three shifts at α = 0.10
- The variation between shifts is **not significantly greater** than the variation within shifts
- We **cannot conclude** that shift has an effect on the dimension of machine parts
- Any observed differences in means (4.147, 4.148, 4.151) are likely due to **random variation** rather than a true shift effect

**Statistical Reasoning:**
- F-statistic < critical F-value (3.24)
- This means: Between-groups variance / Within-groups variance is not large enough
- The variation between groups is not significantly greater than variation within groups
- Therefore, we cannot reject H₀ that all means are equal

**Practical Implication:**
- Shift does not appear to affect machine part dimensions
- All three shifts are producing parts with statistically equivalent dimensions
- No need to investigate shift-specific factors or make shift-based adjustments

**Note:** This does **not** mean the means are exactly equal, only that any differences are not statistically significant (could be due to chance).

## Part f) ANOVA Results Interpretation (3 marks)

### **Given ANOVA Summary Table**

| Source of Variation | SS | df | MS | F | P-value | Critical F |
|---------------------|----|----|----|---|--------|-----------|
| **Between Groups** | 0.0001 | 2 | 6.89E-05 | **0.406** | **0.669** | 3.22 |
| **Within Groups** | 0.0071 | 42 | 0.0001697 | | | |
| **Total** | 0.0073 | 44 | | | | |

**Key Values:**
- **F-statistic:** 0.406
- **P-value:** 0.669
- **Critical F:** 3.22 (at α = 0.10, as used in part e-ii)
- **df (Between):** 2
- **df (Within):** 42

---

### (i) Conclusion from F-Score (1 mark)

**F-Statistic Comparison:**
- **Calculated F:** 0.406
- **Critical F:** 3.22 (from table, at α = 0.10)

**Decision Rule:**
- If F > Critical F, reject H₀
- If F ≤ Critical F, fail to reject H₀

**Comparison:**
- 0.406 < 3.22
- **F-statistic is smaller than critical F-value**

**Conclusion:**
**Fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀).**

**Interpretation:**
- There is **no statistically significant difference** in mean machine part dimensions among the three shifts at α = 0.10
- The F-statistic (0.406) indicates that the variation **between groups** is **not significantly greater** than the variation **within groups**
- The between-groups variance is actually **smaller** than the within-groups variance (F < 1), suggesting groups are very similar
- We **cannot conclude** that shift has an effect on machine part dimensions
- Any observed differences in sample means are likely due to **random sampling variation**

**Statistical Meaning:**
- F = 0.406 means between-groups variance is less than within-groups variance
- This suggests the groups (shifts) are very similar to each other
- The shifts are producing parts with statistically equivalent dimensions

---

### (ii) Comparison: P-value vs Significance Level (2 marks)

**Given Values:**
- **P-value:** 0.669
- **Significance Level (α):** 0.10 (as used in part e-ii)

**Decision Rule Using P-value:**
- If **p-value < α**, reject H₀ (statistically significant)
- If **p-value ≥ α**, fail to reject H₀ (not statistically significant)

**Comparison:**
- **P-value (0.669) > Significance Level (0.10)**
- 0.669 is **much larger** than 0.10

**Conclusion:**
**Fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀).**

**Interpretation:**
- The p-value of **0.669** means there is a **66.9% probability** of observing the data (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true
- This is **much higher** than the acceptable significance level of 0.10 (10%)
- The results are **not statistically significant**
- We **cannot reject** the null hypothesis that all shift means are equal

**Same Conclusion:**
**Yes, you would arrive at the same conclusion** using the p-value method as using the F-statistic comparison method.

**Reasoning:**
- **F-method:** F (0.406) < Critical F (3.22) → Fail to reject H₀
- **P-value method:** P-value (0.669) > α (0.10) → Fail to reject H₀
- **Both methods lead to the same conclusion:** No significant difference among shifts

**Why Both Methods Agree:**
- The p-value and F-statistic are **mathematically related**
- When F < Critical F, the p-value will be > α
- When F > Critical F, the p-value will be < α
- They are **equivalent decision criteria** - just different ways of expressing the same statistical decision

**Additional Interpretation:**
- **P-value = 0.669** is quite large, indicating **strong evidence in favor of H₀**
- There is a **high probability** (66.9%) that the observed differences are due to chance
- The data provides **no evidence** that shifts differ in their mean dimensions
- This is consistent with the very small F-statistic (0.406), which indicates minimal between-groups variation
