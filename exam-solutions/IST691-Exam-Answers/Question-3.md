## Part a) Experimental Concepts (6 marks)

### (i) Extraneous Variable (2 marks)

**Definition:**
An **extraneous variable** is any variable other than the independent variable that could potentially affect the dependent variable and thus confound the results of an experiment. These variables are not of primary interest to the researcher but can influence the outcome if not controlled.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Not the IV:** Different from the independent variable being studied
- **Potential Influence:** Can affect the dependent variable
- **Unwanted:** Not the focus of the research
- **Confounding:** Can create false conclusions about cause-effect relationships
- **Must be Controlled:** Should be identified and controlled to ensure valid results

**Examples:**
- **In a study on teaching methods and student performance:**
  - Extraneous variables: Student intelligence, prior knowledge, motivation, teacher quality, class size, time of day
- **In a drug trial:**
  - Extraneous variables: Age, gender, diet, exercise, other medications, lifestyle factors
- **In a memory experiment:**
  - Extraneous variables: Time of day, noise level, temperature, participant fatigue, attention span

**Types of Extraneous Variables:**

**1. Participant Variables:**
- Individual characteristics of participants
- Examples: Age, gender, intelligence, prior experience, motivation, personality

**2. Situational Variables:**
- Environmental factors in the experimental setting
- Examples: Temperature, lighting, noise, time of day, location

**3. Experimenter Variables:**
- Characteristics or behaviors of the researcher
- Examples: Researcher expectations, personality, gender, experience

**4. Procedural Variables:**
- Aspects of the experimental procedure
- Examples: Order of tasks, instructions given, time allowed

**Impact:**
- Can create **confounding** - making it unclear if the IV or extraneous variable caused the effect
- Threatens **internal validity** - the ability to conclude that the IV caused changes in the DV
- Can lead to **false conclusions** about cause-effect relationships

**Control Methods:**
- **Randomization:** Random assignment to groups
- **Matching:** Matching participants on extraneous variables
- **Holding Constant:** Keeping extraneous variables constant across conditions
- **Statistical Control:** Using statistical techniques to control for extraneous variables

### (ii) Internal Validity (2 marks)

**Definition:**
**Internal validity** refers to the extent to which a research study can establish a causal relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. It addresses whether the observed changes in the dependent variable are actually caused by the independent variable, rather than by other extraneous or confounding variables.

**Key Concept:**
- **Causality:** Can we conclude that the IV caused the DV?
- **Control:** Are alternative explanations ruled out?
- **Confidence:** How confident are we in the cause-effect relationship?

**High Internal Validity:**
- Strong evidence that the IV caused changes in the DV
- Alternative explanations have been ruled out
- Extraneous variables are controlled
- Can confidently conclude cause-effect relationship

**Low Internal Validity:**
- Uncertainty about whether IV caused changes in DV
- Alternative explanations are possible
- Extraneous variables may have influenced results
- Cannot confidently conclude cause-effect relationship

**Threats to Internal Validity:**

**1. History:**
- External events occurring during the study that affect results
- Example: A major news event during a study on anxiety

**2. Maturation:**
- Natural changes in participants over time
- Example: Participants getting older, more experienced, or more tired

**3. Testing:**
- Effects of taking a test on subsequent test performance
- Example: Practice effects from pre-test affecting post-test

**4. Instrumentation:**
- Changes in measurement instruments or procedures
- Example: Different observers, changed scoring criteria

**5. Statistical Regression:**
- Tendency for extreme scores to move toward the mean on retesting
- Example: Very high or low scores regressing toward average

**6. Selection:**
- Differences between groups that exist before the study
- Example: One group already better than another before treatment

**7. Mortality/Attrition:**
- Loss of participants during the study
- Example: Dropouts may differ from those who complete the study

**8. Diffusion of Treatment:**
- Treatment effects spreading to control group
- Example: Control group learning about treatment

**Improving Internal Validity:**
- Use control groups
- Random assignment
- Control extraneous variables
- Use appropriate experimental design
- Minimize threats through design choices

### (iii) Constancy (2 marks)

**Definition:**
**Constancy** (also called **holding constant** or **controlling variables**) is a technique used in experimental research to control extraneous variables by keeping them constant (unchanged) across all experimental conditions or groups. This ensures that any differences in the dependent variable are due to the independent variable, not to extraneous variables.

**Key Concept:**
- **Same Conditions:** Keep extraneous variables the same for all groups/conditions
- **Eliminate Variation:** Remove the influence of extraneous variables
- **Control:** Ensure extraneous variables don't affect results

**Purpose:**
- To eliminate the influence of extraneous variables
- To ensure that only the independent variable differs between conditions
- To increase internal validity
- To allow confident conclusions about cause-effect relationships

**How It Works:**
- Identify extraneous variables that could affect the dependent variable
- Keep these variables constant (same value/condition) for all participants or groups
- Only the independent variable is allowed to vary
- Any differences in the dependent variable can then be attributed to the independent variable

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Teaching Method Study**
- **Extraneous Variable:** Time of day
- **Constancy:** Conduct all classes at the same time of day (e.g., all at 10:00 AM)
- **Result:** Time of day cannot affect results because it's the same for all groups

**Example 2: Drug Trial**
- **Extraneous Variable:** Diet
- **Constancy:** Provide the same meals to all participants
- **Result:** Diet cannot affect results because it's controlled

**Example 3: Memory Experiment**
- **Extraneous Variables:** Temperature, lighting, noise
- **Constancy:** Conduct all sessions in the same room with same temperature, lighting, and noise level
- **Result:** Environmental factors cannot affect results

**Example 4: Exercise Study**
- **Extraneous Variable:** Age
- **Constancy:** Only include participants aged 25-30 years
- **Result:** Age cannot affect results because it's held constant

**Advantages:**
- Simple and straightforward
- Effective for controlling known extraneous variables
- Increases internal validity
- Easy to implement

**Limitations:**
- Can only control variables that are identified
- May limit generalizability (external validity)
- May not be practical for all variables
- Cannot control all possible extraneous variables

**When to Use:**
- When extraneous variables are known and can be controlled
- When it's practical to keep variables constant
- When you want to eliminate specific sources of variation
- Often used in combination with other control techniques

## Part b) Techniques for Achieving Constancy (4 marks)

### (i) Randomization (2 marks)

**Definition:**
**Randomization** (also called **random assignment**) is a technique for controlling extraneous variables by randomly assigning participants to different experimental conditions or groups. This ensures that extraneous variables are distributed equally across groups by chance, eliminating systematic bias.

**Key Concept:**
- **Random Assignment:** Participants assigned to groups randomly (by chance)
- **Equal Distribution:** Extraneous variables distributed equally across groups
- **No Bias:** No systematic differences between groups
- **Chance:** Uses probability to balance groups

**How It Works:**
1. Identify all participants in the study
2. Use a random process (random number generator, coin flip, etc.) to assign each participant to a group
3. Each participant has an equal chance of being in any group
4. Extraneous variables are distributed randomly across groups
5. On average, groups will be equivalent on extraneous variables

**Example:**
- **Study:** Testing effectiveness of two teaching methods
- **Participants:** 100 students
- **Randomization:** Use random number generator to assign 50 to Method A, 50 to Method B
- **Result:** Intelligence, prior knowledge, motivation, etc. should be roughly equal in both groups

**Advantages:**
1. **Controls Unknown Variables:** Works even for extraneous variables you haven't identified
2. **Equal Distribution:** On average, groups are equivalent on all variables
3. **No Bias:** Eliminates systematic differences between groups
4. **Statistical Validity:** Allows use of inferential statistics
5. **High Internal Validity:** Strong control technique

**Mechanisms:**
- **Random Number Tables:** Use published random number tables
- **Computer Randomization:** Use random number generators
- **Lottery Method:** Draw names from a hat
- **Coin Flip:** For two-group designs

**Requirements:**
- Must be truly random (not systematic)
- Each participant must have equal probability of assignment
- Cannot be predictable or manipulated

**Limitations:**
- Works "on average" - may not perfectly balance in small samples
- Requires sufficient sample size for effectiveness
- Cannot guarantee perfect balance in any single study
- Some imbalance may still occur by chance

**When to Use:**
- Experimental designs with multiple groups
- When you want to control for unknown extraneous variables
- When you need high internal validity
- Standard practice in experimental research

### (ii) Matching (2 marks)

**Definition:**
**Matching** (also called **pairing** or **blocking**) is a technique for controlling extraneous variables by ensuring that participants in different groups are equivalent (matched) on one or more extraneous variables that are known to be related to the dependent variable.

**Key Concept:**
- **Pairing:** Match participants on extraneous variables
- **Equivalence:** Groups are similar on matched variables
- **Control:** Eliminates the influence of matched variables
- **Systematic:** Deliberate matching, not random

**How It Works:**
1. Identify extraneous variables that are likely to affect the dependent variable
2. Measure these variables for all participants
3. Match participants on these variables
4. Assign one member of each matched pair to each group
5. Groups are now equivalent on the matched variables

**Example:**
- **Study:** Testing effectiveness of two teaching methods
- **Extraneous Variable:** Prior mathematics knowledge (IQ or pretest scores)
- **Matching Process:**
  - Measure mathematics knowledge for all 100 students
  - Rank students by mathematics knowledge
  - Match students with similar scores (e.g., highest two, next two, etc.)
  - Randomly assign one from each pair to Method A, other to Method B
- **Result:** Both groups have equivalent mathematics knowledge

**Types of Matching:**

**1. Pairwise Matching:**
- Match participants in pairs
- One from each pair goes to each group
- Most common form

**2. Block Matching:**
- Match participants in blocks (groups of 3, 4, etc.)
- Distribute across groups within each block
- Used when there are more than 2 groups

**3. Frequency Distribution Matching:**
- Ensure groups have similar distributions of the variable
- Groups have same proportion of high, medium, low scores

**Advantages:**
1. **Controls Known Variables:** Effective for variables you know are important
2. **Precise Control:** Can ensure exact equivalence on matched variables
3. **Increases Power:** Can increase statistical power by reducing error variance
4. **Targeted:** Focuses on variables most likely to affect results

**Limitations:**
1. **Only Known Variables:** Can only match on variables you identify and measure
2. **Time Consuming:** Requires measuring and matching participants
3. **Limited Variables:** Difficult to match on many variables simultaneously
4. **Loss of Participants:** May need to exclude participants who can't be matched
5. **Unknown Variables:** Doesn't control for variables you haven't identified

**When to Use:**
- When you know specific extraneous variables are important
- When you have a small sample size
- When you want precise control over specific variables
- When matching is practical and feasible

**Comparison with Randomization:**
- **Randomization:** Controls all variables (known and unknown) on average
- **Matching:** Controls specific known variables precisely
- Often used together: Match on important variables, randomize assignment within matches

## Part c) Randomization Concepts (10 marks)

### i) Randomization Terminology (6 marks)

#### i-1) Representative Sample (2 marks)

**Definition:**
A **representative sample** is a sample that accurately reflects the characteristics, attributes, and diversity of the population from which it is drawn. The sample should be similar to the population on all relevant variables and characteristics.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Similarity:** Sample characteristics mirror population characteristics
- **Proportionality:** Proportions in sample match proportions in population
- **Diversity:** Sample includes all relevant subgroups in appropriate proportions
- **Accuracy:** Sample is an accurate miniature version of the population

**Purpose:**
- To ensure that findings from the sample can be generalized to the population
- To increase external validity (generalizability)
- To make inferences about the population based on sample data
- To ensure sample is not biased or skewed

**Example:**
- **Population:** All university students in Cameroon
- **Characteristics:** 60% male, 40% female; various ages, programs, years of study
- **Representative Sample:** Sample with 60% male, 40% female; similar age distribution, program distribution, etc.
- **Result:** Findings from sample can be generalized to all university students

**Achieving Representativeness:**
- **Random Sampling:** Using probability sampling methods
- **Stratified Sampling:** Ensuring subgroups are represented proportionally
- **Large Sample Size:** Larger samples more likely to be representative
- **No Bias:** Avoiding systematic bias in sampling

**Threats to Representativeness:**
- **Sampling Bias:** Systematic exclusion of certain groups
- **Non-response:** Participants who don't respond may differ from those who do
- **Convenience Sampling:** Using easily accessible participants
- **Volunteer Bias:** Participants who volunteer may differ from non-volunteers

**Importance:**
- Essential for **external validity** (generalizability)
- Allows confident generalization from sample to population
- Critical for survey research and descriptive studies
- Foundation for inferential statistics

#### i-2) Random Sampling (2 marks)

**Definition:**
**Random sampling** (also called **probability sampling**) is a sampling technique in which every member of the population has an equal and known probability of being selected for the sample. Selection is based on chance, not on researcher choice or convenience.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Equal Probability:** Every population member has equal chance of selection
- **Known Probability:** The probability of selection is known and calculable
- **Chance-Based:** Selection is random, not systematic or biased
- **No Researcher Bias:** Researcher doesn't choose who is selected

**Purpose:**
- To obtain a representative sample
- To eliminate sampling bias
- To allow generalization to the population
- To enable use of inferential statistics
- To ensure external validity

**How It Works:**
1. Define the population clearly
2. Create a sampling frame (list of all population members)
3. Use a random process to select participants
4. Each member has equal probability of selection
5. Selection is independent (one selection doesn't affect others)

**Methods:**

**1. Simple Random Sampling:**
- Each member has equal probability
- Use random number generator or lottery method
- Most basic form

**2. Systematic Random Sampling:**
- Select every nth member after random start
- Example: Random start at 5, then select every 10th person (5, 15, 25, ...)

**3. Stratified Random Sampling:**
- Divide population into strata (subgroups)
- Randomly sample from each stratum
- Ensures representation of subgroups

**4. Cluster Random Sampling:**
- Randomly select clusters (groups)
- Include all members of selected clusters
- Used when population is naturally grouped

**Example:**
- **Population:** 10,000 university students
- **Sample Size Needed:** 500 students
- **Process:** 
  - Assign each student a number (1-10,000)
  - Use random number generator to select 500 numbers
  - Students with those numbers are in the sample
- **Result:** Each student had 500/10,000 = 5% chance of selection

**Advantages:**
- Eliminates sampling bias
- Produces representative samples
- Allows statistical inference
- High external validity
- Unbiased selection

**Requirements:**
- Complete sampling frame (list of all population members)
- Access to all population members
- Random selection mechanism

- To allow causal inferences

**How It Works:**
1. Recruit participants for the study
2. Use random process to assign each participant to a group
3. Each participant has equal probability of assignment to any group

### ii) Approaches to Randomization (4 marks)

#### ii-1) Simple Random Sampling (2 marks)

**Definition:**
**Simple random sampling** is a probability sampling method where every member of the population has an equal and independent chance of being selected for the sample. It is the most basic form of random sampling.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Equal Probability:** Every population member has exactly the same probability of selection
- **Independence:** Selection of one member doesn't affect selection of others
- **No Stratification:** Population is not divided into subgroups
- **Pure Random:** Selection is completely random with no systematic pattern

**How It Works:**
1. **Define Population:** Clearly identify the target population
2. **Create Sampling Frame:** List all members of the population (complete list)
3. **Assign Numbers:** Give each member a unique number
4. **Random Selection:** Use random process to select numbers
5. **Select Members:** Members with selected numbers are in the sample

**Methods of Selection:**

**1. Random Number Generator:**
- Use computer or calculator to generate random numbers
- Match numbers to population members
- Select those members

**2. Random Number Tables:**
- Use published tables of random numbers
- Start at random point in table
- Read numbers sequentially
- Match to population members

**3. Lottery Method:**
- Write each population member's name/number on a ticket
- Place all tickets in a container
- Mix thoroughly
- Draw tickets randomly
- Selected tickets form the sample

**Example:**
- **Population:** 5,000 university students
- **Sample Size:** 200 students
- **Process:**
  1. List all 5,000 students
  2. Assign numbers 1-5,000
  3. Use random number generator to select 200 numbers between 1-5,000
  4. Students with those numbers are selected
- **Result:** Each student had 200/5,000 = 4% chance of selection

**Advantages:**
- Simple and straightforward
- Easy to understand and implement
- Unbiased selection
- Each member has equal chance
- No complex procedures needed

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires complete population list
- May not ensure representation of subgroups
- Small subgroups may not be represented
- May be inefficient for large, diverse populations
- Doesn't guarantee proportional representation

**When to Use:**
- When population is homogeneous (similar characteristics)
- When you have a complete sampling frame
- When you want simple, unbiased sampling
- When subgroups representation is not critical
- Small to medium population sizes

---

#### ii-2) Stratified Random Sampling (2 marks)

**Definition:**
**Stratified random sampling** is a probability sampling method where the population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on relevant characteristics, and then a random sample is drawn from each stratum. This ensures that each subgroup is represented in the sample.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stratification:** Population divided into homogeneous subgroups (strata)
- **Proportional or Equal:** Sampling can be proportional or equal from each stratum
- **Random Within Strata:** Random sampling within each stratum
- **Representation:** Ensures all subgroups are represented

**How It Works:**
1. **Identify Strata:** Divide population into relevant subgroups (strata)
2. **Define Strata:** Based on characteristics important to research (e.g., gender, age, program)
3. **List Members:** Create list of all members in each stratum
4. **Determine Sample Size:** Decide how many from each stratum (proportional or equal)
5. **Random Sample:** Use simple random sampling within each stratum
6. **Combine:** Combine samples from all strata to form final sample

**Types:**

**1. Proportional Stratified Sampling:**
- Sample size from each stratum is proportional to stratum size in population
- Example: If 60% of population is male, 60% of sample should be male
- Maintains population proportions

**2. Equal Stratified Sampling:**
- Same number of participants from each stratum
- Example: 50 males and 50 females, regardless of population proportions
- Useful when comparing subgroups

**Example:**
- **Population:** 10,000 university students
  - 6,000 males (60%)
  - 4,000 females (40%)
- **Sample Size Needed:** 500 students
- **Proportional Stratified Sampling:**
  - Male stratum: 60% of 500 = 300 males (randomly select 300 from 6,000)
  - Female stratum: 40% of 500 = 200 females (randomly select 200 from 4,000)
- **Process:**
  1. List all 6,000 males, randomly select 300
  2. List all 4,000 females, randomly select 200
  3. Combine: 300 + 200 = 500 students
- **Result:** Sample proportions (60% male, 40% female) match population proportions

**Advantages:**
- **Representation:** Ensures all subgroups are represented
- **Proportionality:** Can maintain population proportions
- **Precision:** Can increase precision by reducing sampling error
- **Comparison:** Allows comparison between subgroups
- **Efficiency:** More efficient than simple random sampling for diverse populations

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity:** More complex than simple random sampling
- **Stratification Variables:** Must identify relevant variables for stratification
- **Complete Lists:** Need complete lists for each stratum
- **Time Consuming:** More time-consuming to implement
- **Knowledge Required:** Need to know population characteristics

**When to Use:**
- When population has distinct subgroups
- When you want to ensure subgroup representation
- When subgroups may differ on variables of interest
- When you want to compare subgroups
- When population is heterogeneous (diverse)

**Key Considerations:**
- **Stratification Variables:** Choose variables related to research question
- **Strata Definition:** Strata should be homogeneous within, heterogeneous between
- **Sample Size:** Ensure sufficient sample size in each stratum
- **Proportional vs. Equal:** Choose based on research goals
