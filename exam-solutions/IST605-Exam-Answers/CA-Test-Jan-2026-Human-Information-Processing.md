## Question 1: Multiple Choice Questions (10 marks)

Write the letter that corresponds to the correct answer to each of the questions below.

### a) Selective attention allows individuals to

**Answer: B) Ignore distractions and focus on one task**

**Explanation:**
- **Selective attention** is the cognitive process that enables individuals to focus on specific stimuli while filtering out irrelevant or distracting information
- It acts as a "filter" that allows us to concentrate on one task or source of information at a time
- This is essential for effective information processing, as the brain has limited capacity
- **Option A is incorrect:** Selective attention does NOT allow focusing on multiple tasks simultaneously - that would be divided attention
- **Option C is incorrect:** Selective attention does NOT process all information equally - it selectively processes relevant information
- **Option D is incorrect:** Selective attention does NOT avoid all stimuli - it selectively processes some while ignoring others

**Key Concept:** Selective attention is the ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant distractions.

---

### b) Which concept suggests that attention is like a limited resource?

**Answer: B) Capacity model of attention**

**Explanation:**
- The **Capacity Model of Attention** (proposed by Kahneman, 1973) views attention as a limited cognitive resource that can be allocated to different tasks
- According to this model, attention has a finite capacity, and tasks compete for this limited resource
- When tasks require more attention than available, performance degrades
- **Option A is incorrect:** Attention load theory (perceptual load theory) focuses on how task difficulty affects attention, not the resource metaphor
- **Option C is incorrect:** Visual perception theory is about how we process visual information, not attention resources
- **Option D is incorrect:** Parallel processing suggests multiple processes can occur simultaneously, which contradicts the limited resource view

**Key Concept:** The capacity model treats attention as a limited pool of mental energy that must be distributed across tasks.

---

### c) Bottom-up processing is driven by:

**Answer: B) External stimuli**

**Explanation:**
- **Bottom-up processing** (also called data-driven processing) is driven by **external stimuli** from the environment
- Information flows from the sensory receptors upward to higher-level cognitive processing
- It begins with raw sensory input and builds up to more complex perceptions
- Processing is guided by the characteristics of the stimulus itself, not prior knowledge
- **Option A is incorrect:** Prior knowledge drives top-down processing, not bottom-up
- **Option C is incorrect:** Bottom-up processing is NOT driven by prior knowledge and experience
- **Option D is incorrect:** While reflexes are automatic, bottom-up processing is broader than just reflex actions

**Key Concept:** Bottom-up processing = stimulus-driven, starting from sensory input and building upward.

**Example:** Recognizing a shape by analyzing its edges, lines, and angles first, then identifying it as a triangle.

---

### d) Top-down processing is driven by:

**Answer: C) Prior knowledge and experience**

**Explanation:**
- **Top-down processing** (also called concept-driven processing) is driven by **prior knowledge, expectations, and experience**
- Information flows from higher-level cognitive processes downward to influence perception
- It uses context, expectations, and stored knowledge to interpret sensory information
- Processing is guided by what we already know, expect, or have learned
- **Option A is partially correct but incomplete:** Prior knowledge alone doesn't capture the full scope - experience is also crucial
- **Option B is incorrect:** External stimuli drive bottom-up processing, not top-down
- **Option D is incorrect:** Reflex actions are automatic responses, not top-down processing

**Key Concept:** Top-down processing = knowledge-driven, using expectations and prior knowledge to interpret stimuli.

**Example:** Reading a word with missing letters by using context and prior knowledge to fill in the gaps (e.g., "T_E" in context of "cat" becomes "THE").

---

### e) Which theory explains how we perceive objects as whole units rather than fragmented parts?

**Answer: C) Gestalt theory**

**Explanation:**
- **Gestalt theory** (founded by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka) explains how we perceive objects as organized wholes rather than collections of separate parts
- The central principle is "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
- Gestalt principles include: proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, and figure-ground
- **Option A is incorrect:** Feature integration theory explains how features are combined into objects, but focuses on attention, not holistic perception
- **Option B is incorrect:** Signal detection theory explains how we detect signals in noise, not holistic perception
- **Option D is incorrect:** Perceptual load theory explains how task difficulty affects attention, not holistic perception

**Key Concept:** Gestalt psychology emphasizes that perception is organized and structured, with the mind automatically organizing sensory input into meaningful wholes.

**Example:** Seeing a triangle as a complete triangle, not as three separate lines.

---

### f) The spacing effect suggests that learning is improved when

**Answer: B) Studied over multiple sessions**

**Explanation:**
- The **spacing effect** (also called distributed practice) is a cognitive phenomenon where learning is more effective when study sessions are **spaced out over time** rather than massed together
- Information studied across multiple sessions with intervals between them is better remembered than information studied in one long session
- This is one of the most robust findings in memory research
- **Option A is incorrect:** One long session is massed practice, which is less effective than spaced practice
- **Option C is incorrect:** Cramming just before testing (massed practice) is less effective than spaced learning
- **Option D is incorrect:** While repetition is important, the spacing effect specifically refers to the timing of repetition (spaced vs. massed)

**Key Concept:** Distributed practice (spacing) is superior to massed practice for long-term retention.

**Example:** Studying for 1 hour each day for 5 days is better than studying for 5 hours in one day.

---

### g) The "bottleneck" in attentional theories primarily refers to the point where:

**Answer: B) the amount of information the brain can process at any given moment becomes limited**

**Explanation:**
- The **bottleneck** metaphor in attention theory refers to the **limited capacity** of the cognitive system to process information
- It represents the point where the flow of information is constrained because the brain can only handle a limited amount of information at once
- This bottleneck forces selection - some information passes through while other information is filtered out
- **Option A is incorrect:** Forgetting from short-term memory is a separate process (decay/interference), not the bottleneck itself
- **Option C is incorrect:** Response initiation is an output process, while the bottleneck refers to input/processing limitations
- **Option D is incorrect:** Sensory input reception is not limited - the bottleneck occurs during processing, not at initial reception

**Key Concept:** The bottleneck represents the limited capacity point where information processing is constrained, requiring selective attention.

**Models:** Broadbent's filter model, Treisman's attenuation model, and late selection models all address where this bottleneck occurs in the processing stream.

---

### h) What's the primary role of working memory?

**Answer: B) Active maintenance and manipulation of information**

**Explanation:**
- **Working memory** is a cognitive system responsible for the **temporary storage and active manipulation** of information needed for complex cognitive tasks
- It actively maintains information in an accessible state while performing mental operations on it
- It's not just storage - it involves active processing, manipulation, and transformation of information
- **Option A is incorrect:** Permanent storage of facts is the role of long-term memory, not working memory
- **Option C is incorrect:** Initial sensory registration is the role of sensory memory, not working memory
- **Option D is incorrect:** Long-term memory retrieval involves accessing stored information, but working memory is where retrieved information is actively used

**Key Concept:** Working memory = temporary storage + active manipulation of information for ongoing cognitive tasks.

**Baddeley's Model:** Working memory includes the central executive (control), phonological loop (verbal), visuospatial sketchpad (visual), and episodic buffer (integration).

---

### i) An instructor asks you to mentally picture a map. Which component is primarily used?

**Answer: D) Visuospatial Sketchpad**

**Explanation:**
- The **Visuospatial Sketchpad** (part of Baddeley's working memory model) is responsible for storing and manipulating **visual and spatial information**
- When you mentally picture or visualize something (like a map), you are using the visuospatial sketchpad
- It handles visual imagery, spatial relationships, and mental rotation tasks
- **Option A is incorrect:** The Executive controls attention and coordinates other components, but doesn't store visual information
- **Option B is incorrect:** The Phonological Loop handles verbal/auditory information, not visual imagery
- **Option C is incorrect:** The Episodic Buffer integrates information from different sources, but the primary storage for visual imagery is the visuospatial sketchpad

**Key Concept:** Visuospatial sketchpad = working memory component for visual and spatial information.

**Example:** Mentally rotating a 3D object, visualizing a route on a map, or imagining the layout of a room.

---

### j) An instructor reads out a phone number for you to dial. Which component is primarily used?

**Answer: B) Phonological Loop**

**Explanation:**
- The **Phonological Loop** (part of Baddeley's working memory model) is responsible for storing and rehearsing **verbal and auditory information**
- When someone reads out a phone number, you hear the sounds (phonological input) and need to maintain them temporarily
- The phonological loop has two components:
  - **Phonological Store:** Holds auditory information for 1-2 seconds
  - **Articulatory Rehearsal Process:** Repeats the information to maintain it
- **Option A is incorrect:** The Executive coordinates the system but doesn't store the phone number
- **Option C is incorrect:** The Episodic Buffer integrates information but the primary storage for verbal/auditory information is the phonological loop
- **Option D is incorrect:** The Visuospatial Sketchpad handles visual/spatial information, not auditory/verbal information

**Key Concept:** Phonological loop = working memory component for verbal and auditory information.

**Example:** Remembering a phone number you just heard, mentally repeating a list of words, or holding onto verbal instructions.

## Question 2: Fill in the Blanks (8 marks)

Write the correct word chosen from the following list below, to fill each blank in the statements below:

**Word List:** Attention, Behaviorism, Cognitive psychology, Empiricism, Introspectionism, Intuition, Perception

---

### a) ________ is the ability to understand or know something instantly, without conscious reasoning, often a gut feeling.

**Answer: Intuition**

**Explanation:**
- **Intuition** refers to the ability to understand or know something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning or analytical thought
- It's often described as a "gut feeling" or immediate insight
- Intuition involves rapid, automatic processing that doesn't require explicit step-by-step reasoning
- It can be based on implicit knowledge, pattern recognition, or accumulated experience

**Example:** Knowing that something feels "off" about a situation without being able to explain why, or immediately recognizing the solution to a problem.

---

### b) ________ is the belief that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience and observation, not innate ideas.

**Answer: Empiricism**

**Explanation:**
- **Empiricism** is the philosophical and psychological approach that emphasizes that knowledge comes primarily from **sensory experience and observation**
- Empiricists believe that the mind starts as a "blank slate" (tabula rasa) and that all knowledge is acquired through experience
- This contrasts with **nativism** or **rationalism**, which suggests that some knowledge is innate or comes from reason alone
- Key empiricist philosophers include John Locke, David Hume, and George Berkeley

**Key Principle:** "There is nothing in the mind that was not first in the senses."

**Contrast:** Empiricism (experience-based) vs. Nativism/Rationalism (innate knowledge or reason-based).

---

### c) ________ was an early psychological approach that used self-observation to study consciousness by having people report their inner thoughts and feelings.

**Answer: Introspectionism**

**Explanation:**
- **Introspectionism** (also called Structuralism) was an early psychological approach developed by Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener
- It involved **systematic self-observation** where trained observers would report their inner thoughts, feelings, and mental experiences
- The goal was to break down consciousness into its basic elements (sensations, feelings, images)
- Participants would be exposed to stimuli and asked to describe their conscious experience in detail
- This method was criticized for being subjective and unreliable, leading to its decline

**Key Figure:** Wilhelm Wundt (founded first psychology laboratory in 1879)

**Limitation:** Introspection is subjective and cannot be independently verified, making it difficult to establish reliable scientific findings.

---

### d) ________ focuses on observations of people based on what they learn from environmental stimuli like rewards and punishments, viewing the mind as a black box.

**Answer: Behaviorism**

**Explanation:**
- **Behaviorism** is a psychological approach that focuses on **observable behavior** and how it is learned through interactions with the environment
- Behaviorists study how environmental stimuli (rewards, punishments, conditioning) shape behavior
- The mind is treated as a **"black box"** - behaviorists don't study internal mental processes, only observable inputs (stimuli) and outputs (responses)
- Key figures include John B. Watson, B.F. Skinner, and Ivan Pavlov
- Behaviorism emphasizes that behavior is learned through conditioning (classical and operant)

**Key Principle:** Focus on observable behavior, not unobservable mental processes.

**Contrast:** Behaviorism (observable behavior only) vs. Cognitive Psychology (studies internal mental processes).

---

### e) ________ investigates internal mental processes (memory, thinking, problem-solving) to explain behaviour, seeing the learner as an active information processor.

**Answer: Cognitive psychology**

**Explanation:**
- **Cognitive psychology** is the branch of psychology that investigates **internal mental processes** such as memory, thinking, problem-solving, attention, perception, and language
- Unlike behaviorism, cognitive psychology studies what happens "inside the black box" - the mental processes that underlie behavior
- It views the learner/mind as an **active information processor** that takes in, stores, transforms, and retrieves information
- Cognitive psychology uses the computer as a metaphor for the mind (information processing approach)
- Key figures include Ulric Neisser, George Miller, and Herbert Simon

**Key Principle:** The mind actively processes information, not just passively responding to stimuli.

**Contrast:** Cognitive Psychology (studies mental processes) vs. Behaviorism (focuses only on observable behavior).

---

### Additional Fill-in-the-Blank Questions (from second page):

### f) ________ is the process of organizing and interpreting sensory information to recognize objects, patterns, and understand the environment.

**Answer: Perception**

**Explanation:**
- **Perception** is the cognitive process of **organizing and interpreting sensory information** to give it meaning
- It involves taking raw sensory input and transforming it into meaningful representations of objects, patterns, and the environment
- Perception goes beyond sensation (detection) to include recognition, interpretation, and understanding
- It involves both bottom-up processing (stimulus-driven) and top-down processing (knowledge-driven)

**Key Concept:** Sensation = detection of stimuli; Perception = interpretation and understanding of stimuli.

**Example:** Seeing lines and shapes (sensation) and recognizing them as a face (perception).

---

### g) ________ is the mental process of selectively concentrating on relevant stimuli and ignoring irrelevant ones.

**Answer: Attention**

**Explanation:**
- **Attention** is the cognitive process of **selectively concentrating** on certain aspects of the environment (relevant stimuli) while **ignoring others** (irrelevant stimuli)
- It acts as a filter that allows us to focus our limited cognitive resources on what's important
- Attention is essential for effective information processing, as we cannot process all incoming information simultaneously
- Types of attention include: selective attention, divided attention, sustained attention, and executive attention

**Key Concept:** Attention = selective focus on relevant information while filtering out irrelevant information.

**Example:** Focusing on a conversation in a noisy room while ignoring background chatter.

## Question 3: Human Information Processing Framework (12 marks)

### a) Explain what the human information processing framework is used for, in cognitive psychology. Your answer should include the relevant analogy to the human mind and activities involved at the core stages of the model. (6 marks)

**Answer:**

**Purpose of the Human Information Processing Framework:**

The **Human Information Processing Framework** is used in cognitive psychology to:

1. **Understand how the mind processes information** - It provides a systematic way to study how information flows through the cognitive system from input to output

2. **Model cognitive processes** - It breaks down complex mental activities into discrete stages that can be studied and understood

3. **Explain behavior** - By understanding how information is processed, we can explain how people perceive, remember, think, and respond

4. **Guide research** - It provides a framework for designing experiments and interpreting findings about cognitive processes

5. **Compare human and computer processing** - It allows comparison between human cognition and artificial intelligence systems

---

**The Computer Analogy:**

The framework uses the **computer as an analogy for the human mind**:

- **Input** (sensory information) → **Processing** (mental operations) → **Storage** (memory) → **Output** (behavior/responses)

Just as a computer receives data input, processes it using programs, stores it in memory, and produces output, the human mind receives sensory input, processes it through cognitive operations, stores it in memory systems, and produces behavioral responses.

**Key Components of the Analogy:**
- **Sensory Input** = Computer input devices (keyboard, mouse)
- **Attention** = CPU processing capacity
- **Memory Systems** = RAM (working memory) and Hard Drive (long-term memory)
- **Cognitive Processes** = Software programs
- **Behavioral Output** = Computer output (screen display, printer)

---

**Core Stages and Activities:**

The human information processing framework typically includes these core stages:

**1. Sensory Input Stage:**
- **Activity:** Reception of environmental stimuli through sensory receptors (eyes, ears, skin, etc.)
- **Process:** Raw sensory data is detected and registered
- **Duration:** Very brief (milliseconds)
- **Capacity:** Large but very temporary

**2. Sensory Memory Stage:**
- **Activity:** Brief storage of sensory information in its original form
- **Process:** Maintains a literal copy of sensory input for a very short time
- **Duration:** 0.5-3 seconds
- **Capacity:** Large but information decays rapidly if not attended to
- **Types:** Iconic memory (visual), Echoic memory (auditory)

**3. Attention/Selection Stage:**
- **Activity:** Selective filtering of information from sensory memory
- **Process:** Relevant information is selected and transferred to working memory; irrelevant information is filtered out
- **Function:** Acts as a bottleneck, limiting what enters further processing
- **Mechanism:** Selective attention, filtering, or attenuation

**4. Working Memory/Short-Term Memory Stage:**
- **Activity:** Active maintenance and manipulation of information
- **Process:** 
  - **Encoding:** Information is encoded into a form that can be maintained
  - **Maintenance Rehearsal:** Repeating information to keep it active
  - **Manipulation:** Performing mental operations on the information
- **Duration:** 15-30 seconds without rehearsal

- **Process:** 
  - **Recognition:** Identifying previously encountered information
  - **Recall:** Actively retrieving information without cues
  - **Reconstruction:** Rebuilding memories from stored fragments
- **Factors:** Cues, context, interference, retrieval strategies

### b) From the diagram above, identify the types of memories involved (A, B, C), and the activities involved at stages P, Q, R, and S. (3 marks)

**Answer:**

**Memory Types:**

**A Memory: Sensory Memory**
- This is **Sensory Memory** (specifically Iconic Memory for visual or Echoic Memory for auditory)
- It receives incoming sensory information from the environment
- Has very brief duration (0.5-3 seconds)
- Large capacity but information decays rapidly if not attended to
- Maintains a literal copy of sensory input

**B Memory: Short-Term Memory / Working Memory**
- This is **Short-Term Memory** or **Working Memory**
- Temporarily stores and actively processes information
- Limited capacity (7±2 items or 4±1 chunks)
- Duration of 15-30 seconds without rehearsal
- Involves active maintenance and manipulation of information

**C Memory: Long-Term Memory**
- This is **Long-Term Memory**
- Permanent storage of information
- Essentially unlimited capacity
- Potentially permanent duration
- Stores organized knowledge and experiences

---

**Activities at Each Stage:**

**P: Attention / Encoding from Sensory to Short-Term Memory**
- **Activity:** **Selective Attention** or **Initial Encoding**
- **Process:** Information is selected from sensory memory and transferred to short-term memory
- This is the **attention filter** that determines which sensory information enters further processing
- Information not selected is lost (forgotten)

**Q: Maintenance Rehearsal / Active Rehearsal**
- **Activity:** **Maintenance Rehearsal** or **Active Rehearsal**
- **Process:** Information in short-term memory is actively repeated or rehearsed to keep it in the system
- The loop-back arrow indicates that information cycles within working memory
- This prevents decay and maintains information in an active, accessible state
- Can also involve manipulation and transformation of information

**R: Encoding / Consolidation from Short-Term to Long-Term Memory**
- **Activity:** **Encoding** or **Consolidation**
- **Process:** Information is transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory through deep processing
- Involves **elaborative rehearsal** - creating meaningful connections and associations
- Information is transformed into a storable format and integrated with existing knowledge
- This is the process of **memory consolidation** - making memories permanent

**S: Retrieval from Long-Term to Short-Term Memory**
- **Activity:** **Retrieval**
- **Process:** Information is accessed from long-term memory and brought back into working memory for use
- This allows stored information to be used in current cognitive tasks
- Retrieval can be through recognition, recall, or reconstruction
- Retrieved information becomes active in working memory again

### c) Comment briefly on the capacities of, and duration of information that is stored in the memories depicted as A, B, and C. (3 marks)

**Answer:**

**A Memory (Sensory Memory):**

**Capacity:**
- **Very large capacity** - Can hold a substantial amount of sensory information
- Iconic memory (visual) can store a complete visual scene
- Echoic memory (auditory) can store several seconds of auditory information
- However, only a small portion of this information is typically attended to and transferred further

**Duration:**
- **Very brief duration** - Information lasts only **0.5 to 3 seconds**
- **Iconic memory:** Approximately **250-500 milliseconds** (less than half a second)
- **Echoic memory:** Approximately **2-4 seconds** (slightly longer than visual)
- Information **decays rapidly** if not attended to
- This brief duration allows for smooth perception of continuous stimuli (e.g., movies, speech)

**Key Point:** Large capacity but extremely brief duration - acts as a buffer that holds raw sensory input briefly before selection.

---

**B Memory (Short-Term Memory / Working Memory):**

**Capacity:**
- **Very limited capacity** - Can hold approximately **7±2 items** (Miller's Magic Number) or **4±1 chunks** (more recent research)
- Capacity can be increased through **chunking** - grouping items into meaningful units
- Limited by the amount of information that can be actively maintained simultaneously
- Different components (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad) have separate limited capacities

**Duration:**
- **Brief duration** - Information lasts approximately **15-30 seconds** without rehearsal
- Can be extended through **maintenance rehearsal** (repeating information)
- Information is lost through:
  - **Decay:** Fading over time if not rehearsed
  - **Interference:** New information displacing old information
- With active rehearsal, information can be maintained longer, but this requires continuous attention

**Key Point:** Limited capacity and brief duration - acts as a temporary workspace for active cognitive processing.

---

**C Memory (Long-Term Memory):**

**Capacity:**
- **Essentially unlimited capacity** - No known limit to how much information can be stored
- Can store vast amounts of information accumulated over a lifetime
- Includes: facts, experiences, skills, concepts, procedures, etc.
- Storage is organized in networks and structures (semantic networks, schemas)

**Duration:**
- **Potentially permanent duration** - Information can last **indefinitely** (lifetime)
- Some memories may last for decades or a lifetime
- However, **retrieval** can be difficult even if information is stored (retrieval failure)
- Information may be subject to:
  - **Forgetting:** Due to interference, decay, or retrieval failure
  - **Distortion:** Memories may be modified or reconstructed over time
  - But the storage itself is considered relatively permanent

**Key Point:** Unlimited capacity and potentially permanent duration - acts as the permanent knowledge base of the cognitive system.

---

**Summary Comparison:**

| Memory Type | Capacity | Duration | Key Characteristic |
|------------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **A: Sensory** | Very large | 0.5-3 seconds | Brief buffer for raw input |
| **B: Short-Term** | Limited (7±2 items) | 15-30 seconds | Temporary workspace |
| **C: Long-Term** | Unlimited | Potentially permanent | Permanent knowledge base |

**Trade-off Pattern:**
- As we move from A → B → C, **capacity decreases** then **increases**, while **duration increases** dramatically
- Sensory memory: Large capacity, very brief duration
- Short-term memory: Small capacity, brief duration
- Long-term memory: Unlimited capacity, permanent duration

This pattern reflects the system's design: brief sensory buffers, limited active workspace, and unlimited permanent storage.
