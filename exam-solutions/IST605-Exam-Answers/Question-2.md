## Part a) Limits to Attention System (4 marks)

### **Why Psychologists Believe There Are Limits to Attention**

**Fundamental Principle:**
Psychologists believe that attention has limits because humans cannot process all available information simultaneously. The attention system has finite capacity, requiring selective processing of information.

---

### **Reason 1: Selective Attention and Information Overload (2 marks)**

**Explanation:**
The environment provides far more information than we can process at any given moment. We are constantly bombarded with sensory input (visual, auditory, tactile, etc.), but we can only attend to a small subset of this information.

**Evidence:**
- **Sensory Overload:** In a typical environment, we receive thousands of bits of information per second
- **Cocktail Party Effect:** At a party with many conversations, we can only focus on one conversation at a time
- **Multiple Stimuli:** We cannot simultaneously read a book, listen to music, watch TV, and have a conversation effectively
- **Selective Processing:** We must choose what to attend to and ignore the rest

**Theoretical Basis:**
- **Limited Capacity Model:** Attention has a fixed capacity that cannot be exceeded
- **Bottleneck Theory:** Attention acts as a bottleneck, filtering information
- **Resource Theory:** Attention is a limited resource that must be allocated

**Implications:**
- We must select what to process
- Some information is inevitably lost or ignored
- Attention requires active selection and filtering
- Multitasking is limited and often ineffective

**Example:**
- **Driving:** You cannot simultaneously read road signs, monitor traffic, listen to radio, and text on phone effectively
- **Classroom:** Students cannot fully attend to lecture while simultaneously checking social media
- **Cocktail Party:** You focus on one conversation while filtering out others

---

### **Reason 2: Dual-Task Interference and Performance Degradation (2 marks)**

**Explanation:**
When people attempt to perform two tasks simultaneously, performance on one or both tasks typically declines. This interference demonstrates that attention has limited capacity that cannot fully support multiple tasks.

**Evidence:**
- **Dual-Task Experiments:** When people perform two tasks at once, performance is worse than performing each task alone
- **Task Interference:** Tasks compete for limited attentional resources
- **Performance Trade-offs:** Improving performance on one task reduces performance on the other
- **Automatic vs Controlled Processing:** Only one controlled task can be performed well at a time

**Theoretical Basis:**
- **Central Capacity Model:** Attention is a single, limited resource pool
- **Multiple Resources:** Different types of attention resources (though still limited)
- **Bottleneck:** Information processing has bottlenecks that limit simultaneous processing

**Types of Interference:**
- **Structural Interference:** Tasks use the same cognitive structures (e.g., both require verbal processing)
- **Resource Interference:** Tasks compete for the same attentional resources
- **Response Interference:** Tasks require incompatible responses

**Examples:**
- **Talking While Driving:** Conversation interferes with driving performance (especially in difficult situations)
- **Reading and Listening:** Cannot fully comprehend both written text and spoken words simultaneously
- **Visual and Auditory Tasks:** Performance declines when doing both simultaneously
- **Cell Phone Use:** Talking on phone while driving significantly impairs driving performance

**Implications:**
- Attention is a limited resource
- Multitasking has costs
- Some tasks can become automatic (requiring less attention)
- Training can reduce interference but not eliminate it

## Part b) Functions of Attention System (6 marks)

### **i) Focusing (2 marks)**

**Definition:**
**Focusing** (also called **selective attention**) is the function of directing attention to specific information, objects, or locations while ignoring or suppressing other information. It involves the selection of relevant information from the many available options.

**Key Characteristics:**

**1. Selection:**
- Choosing what to attend to from multiple options
- Selecting relevant information while ignoring irrelevant information
- Active process of filtering information
- Prioritizing certain inputs over others

**2. Concentration:**
- Maintaining attention on selected information
- Sustaining focus over time
- Resisting distraction from other information
- Deep engagement with selected content

**3. Suppression:**
- Actively ignoring irrelevant information
- Filtering out distractors
- Reducing processing of unattended information
- Preventing interference from irrelevant inputs

**Mechanisms:**
- **Early Selection:** Filtering at early stages of processing (Broadbent's model)
- **Late Selection:** Filtering at later stages (Deutsch & Deutsch model)
- **Attenuation:** Reducing strength of unattended information (Treisman's model)

**Examples:**
- **Visual Focusing:** Looking at a specific person in a crowd
- **Auditory Focusing:** Listening to one conversation at a party (cocktail party effect)
- **Reading:** Focusing on text while ignoring background noise
- **Driving:** Focusing on road ahead while ignoring billboards

**Neural Basis:**
- Prefrontal cortex involved in selection
- Posterior attention network for spatial focusing
- Anterior attention network for focusing on objects/features

**Importance:**
- Essential for effective information processing
- Prevents information overload
- Enables goal-directed behavior
- Critical for learning and memory

---

### **ii) Perceptual Enhancement (2 marks)**

**Definition:**
**Perceptual enhancement** (also called **amplification** or **facilitation**) is the function of improving the processing and perception of attended information. Attention enhances the quality, speed, and accuracy of perception for selected stimuli.

**Key Characteristics:**

**1. Improved Processing:**
- Attended information is processed more efficiently
- Faster detection and recognition of attended stimuli
- More accurate perception of attended information
- Enhanced neural responses to attended stimuli

**2. Increased Sensitivity:**
- Lower threshold for detecting attended stimuli
- Greater sensitivity to attended features
- Enhanced contrast and clarity
- Improved signal-to-noise ratio

**3. Amplification:**
- Strengthening neural responses to attended information
- Increasing activation in relevant brain areas
- Boosting signal strength
- Making attended information more salient

**Mechanisms:**
- **Neural Amplification:** Increased neural firing for attended stimuli
- **Synchronization:** Synchronized neural activity improves processing
- **Resource Allocation:** More processing resources allocated to attended information
- **Feature Binding:** Better integration of features for attended objects

**Examples:**
- **Visual Search:** Attended targets are detected faster and more accurately
- **Cocktail Party Effect:** Your name is detected even when not directly attended
- **Reading:** Attended words are recognized more quickly and accurately
- **Sports:** Attended objects (ball, opponent) are perceived more clearly

**Experimental Evidence:**
- **Priming Effects:** Attended information primes related concepts
- **Response Times:** Faster responses to attended stimuli
- **Accuracy:** Higher accuracy for attended information
- **ERP Studies:** Enhanced event-related potentials for attended stimuli

**Neural Basis:**
- Increased activity in sensory cortices for attended stimuli
- Modulation of neural responses by attention
- Changes in firing rates and synchrony
- Feedback from higher brain areas enhances lower-level processing

**Importance:**
- Improves perception of relevant information
- Enhances performance on tasks
- Facilitates learning and memory
- Critical for effective interaction with environment

---

### **iii) Binding (2 marks)**

**Definition:**
**Binding** (also called **feature integration**) is the function of combining or linking different features (such as color, shape, location, motion) into unified object representations. Attention is crucial for correctly binding features that belong to the same object.

**Key Characteristics:**

**1. Feature Integration:**
- Combining different visual features (color, shape, size, orientation)
- Linking features that belong to the same object
- Creating unified object representations
- Integrating information from different sensory modalities

**2. Object Coherence:**
- Maintaining object integrity (features stay together)
- Preventing incorrect feature combinations
- Ensuring features are correctly associated
- Creating stable object representations

**3. Attention Requirement:**
- Attention is necessary for correct binding
- Without attention, features can be incorrectly combined (illusory conjunctions)
- Focused attention enables accurate feature binding
- Divided attention impairs binding

**Mechanisms:**
- **Feature Integration Theory (Treisman):** Features are initially processed separately, then integrated with attention
- **Location-Based Binding:** Features at the same location are bound together
- **Object-Based Binding:** Features belonging to the same object are bound
- **Temporal Synchrony:** Features processed at the same time are bound

**Examples:**
- **Visual Objects:** Combining color (red), shape (circle), and location to form a "red circle"
- **Faces:** Integrating eye color, hair color, facial features into a coherent face
- **Words:** Combining letters, their positions, and spacing into words
- **Scenes:** Integrating objects, their locations, and relationships into scene understanding

**Problems Without Attention:**
- **Illusory Conjunctions:** Incorrectly combining features from different objects
  - Example: Seeing a red square and blue circle, but reporting a red circle
- **Feature Misbinding:** Features from different objects get combined
- **Object Fragmentation:** Objects are perceived as separate features rather than unified objects

**Experimental Evidence:**
- **Visual Search:** Conjunction search (finding red circle among red squares and blue circles) requires attention
- **Feature Search:** Single features (finding red among green) can be preattentive
- **Illusory Conjunctions:** Occur more when attention is divided or limited
- **Brain Imaging:** Different brain areas for feature processing vs. binding

**Neural Basis:**
- Early visual areas process individual features
- Higher areas (parietal, temporal) integrate features
- Attention modulates binding processes
- Synchronized neural activity for bound features

**Importance:**
- Essential for object recognition
- Enables coherent perception
- Critical for understanding scenes
- Required for effective interaction with objects

## Part c) Dichotic Listening Task and Findings (8 marks)

### **Description of Dichotic Listening Task**

**Definition:**
The **dichotic listening task** is an experimental procedure used to study selective attention, particularly in auditory processing. Participants are presented with two different auditory messages simultaneously, one to each ear, and are asked to attend to one message (the attended ear) while ignoring the other (the unattended ear).

**Procedure:**

**1. Setup:**
- Participants wear headphones
- Two different messages are presented simultaneously
- One message to the left ear, another to the right ear
- Messages are typically speech (words, sentences, stories)

**2. Instructions:**
- **Shadowing Task:** Participants are asked to repeat (shadow) the message from one ear (attended ear)
- **Attended Ear:** The ear they must focus on and shadow
- **Unattended Ear:** The other ear is to be ignored

**3. Variations:**
- **Shadowing:** Repeat the attended message aloud
- **Detection:** Detect target words in attended or unattended ear
- **Recognition:** Later recognition test for unattended information
- **Interruptions:** Sometimes the message switches ears

**Example:**
- **Left Ear (Attended):** "The cat sat on the mat. The dog ran in the park."
- **Right Ear (Unattended):** "The book is on the table. The bird flew away."
- **Task:** Shadow the left ear message while ignoring the right ear

---

### **Key Findings from Dichotic Listening Research**

#### **Finding 1: Successful Selection and Filtering (2 marks)**

**Description:**
Participants can successfully attend to one ear and ignore the other, demonstrating that attention can effectively filter information.

**Evidence:**
- Participants can shadow the attended message with high accuracy (typically 95%+)
- Participants report being unaware of most content from the unattended ear
- Performance on unattended ear is very poor (close to chance)
- Clear difference between attended and unattended processing

**Implications:**
- Attention can effectively filter information
- Selection is possible even with simultaneous competing inputs
- Unattended information is largely ignored
- Demonstrates capacity limitations of attention

---

#### **Finding 2: Limited Processing of Unattended Information (2 marks)**

**Description:**
Although unattended information is largely ignored, some aspects are still processed, suggesting that filtering is not complete.

**Evidence:**
- **Physical Characteristics:** Unattended information is processed at the physical level (pitch, volume, gender of voice)
- **Change Detection:** People notice if unattended message changes to pure tone or silence
- **Gender/Voice Changes:** Changes in speaker gender or voice are detected
- **Limited Semantic Processing:** Very little semantic content is processed from unattended ear

**Implications:**
- Early processing occurs for all information (physical level)
- Filtering occurs at later stages (semantic level)
- Some information "leaks through" the filter
- Supports late-selection or attenuation models rather than strict early selection

---

#### **Finding 3: Cocktail Party Effect (2 marks)**

**Description:**
**Cocktail Party Effect** refers to the finding that highly relevant or important information (like one's own name) can break through from the unattended ear and be noticed.

**Evidence:**
- Participants notice their own name in the unattended ear (about 33% of the time)
- Other personally relevant information is also detected
- Emotionally significant words are sometimes noticed
- However, most unattended information is not noticed

**Implications:**
- Filtering is not absolute
- Important information can penetrate the filter
- Supports attenuation model (information is attenuated, not blocked)
- Demonstrates that unattended information is processed to some degree

**Theoretical Significance:**
- Challenges strict early-selection model (Broadbent)
- Supports attenuation model (Treisman)
- Suggests semantic processing occurs for unattended information
- Shows that relevance/importance influences filtering

---

#### **Finding 4: Switching and Filter Costs (1 mark)**

**Description:**
When attention must switch between ears or when filtering requirements change, there are performance costs.

**Evidence:**
- Performance declines when messages switch ears
- Time is needed to redirect attention
- Errors increase during switching
- Filter reconfiguration takes time and resources

**Implications:**
- Attention switching has costs
- Filter is not instantly reconfigurable
- Demonstrates the effortful nature of attention
- Shows that attention is an active, controlled process

---

#### **Finding 5: Individual Differences and Practice Effects (1 mark)**

**Description:**
People differ in their ability to perform dichotic listening tasks, and performance improves with practice.

**Evidence:**
- Some people are better at selective attention than others
- Performance improves with practice
- Experience with the task reduces interference
- Individual differences in attention capacity

**Implications:**
- Attention abilities vary across individuals
- Attention can be trained and improved
- Experience influences attention performance
- Supports the idea that attention is a skill

---

### **Theoretical Implications**

**1. Early Selection (Broadbent):**
- Supports early filtering
- But challenged by cocktail party effect

**2. Late Selection (Deutsch & Deutsch):**
- Explains why some unattended information is processed
- But doesn't explain why so little is processed

**3. Attenuation (Treisman):**
- Best explains the findings
- Information is attenuated (reduced) not blocked
- Important information can penetrate filter
- Accounts for cocktail party effect

---

## Part d) Broadbent's Model of Attention and Improvements (8 marks)

### **Broadbent's Filter Model (Early Selection Model)**

**Overview:**
Donald Broadbent (1958) proposed the first influential model of attention, known as the **filter model** or **early selection model**. This model was based on findings from dichotic listening experiments and information processing theory.

---

### **Basic Structure of the Model**

**Information Flow:**

```
Sensory Input (All Channels)
        ↓
Sensory Buffer (Short-term Store)
        ↓
Selective Filter (Bottleneck) ← Attention operates here
        ↓
Limited Capacity Channel
        ↓
Higher-Level Processing (Recognition, Memory)
```

**Stages:**

**1. Sensory Input:**
- All sensory information enters the system
- Multiple channels can be active simultaneously
- Information is registered in sensory memory

**2. Sensory Buffer (Preattentive Store):**
- Brief storage of all incoming information
- Information held for very short time (milliseconds to seconds)
- All information is available at this stage
- Capacity is relatively large

**3. Selective Filter (The Key Component):**
- **Location:** Early in processing (before pattern recognition)
- **Function:** Acts as a bottleneck, selecting one channel
- **Selection Basis:** Physical characteristics (pitch, location, voice)
- **Filtering:** One channel passes through, others are blocked
- **All-or-Nothing:** Information is either selected or completely rejected

**4. Limited Capacity Channel:**
- Processes only the selected information
- Has limited capacity
- Performs pattern recognition and semantic analysis
- Information then goes to memory and response systems

**5. Higher-Level Processing:**
- Recognition of words and meanings
- Memory encoding
- Response generation

---

### **Key Features of the Selective Filter**

**1. Early Selection:**
- Filter operates **early** in processing (before pattern recognition)
- Selection occurs before semantic analysis
- Based on **physical characteristics** only (not meaning)
- Examples of selection criteria: ear (left/right), voice pitch, location

**2. All-or-Nothing Filtering:**
- Information is either **selected** (passes through) or **blocked** (completely rejected)
- No partial processing of unattended information
- Unattended information is lost
- No "leakage" of unattended information

**3. Single Channel:**
- Only **one channel** can pass through the filter at a time
- Cannot process multiple channels simultaneously
- Switching between channels is possible but takes time
- Explains why we can't fully attend to multiple things at once

**4. Physical Basis for Selection:**
- Selection based on **physical features**:
  - Which ear (left/right)
  - Voice characteristics (pitch, gender)
  - Location in space
  - Not based on meaning or content

**5. Capacity Limitations:**
- Filter creates a bottleneck
- Limited capacity channel explains why we can't process everything
- Only selected information receives full processing
- Unselected information is lost

---

### **Supporting Evidence for Broadbent's Model**

**1. Successful Shadowing:**
- People can shadow one ear successfully
- Demonstrates that selection is possible
- Supports the idea of a filter

**2. Poor Unattended Processing:**
- People remember very little from unattended ear
- Supports idea that unattended information is blocked
- Suggests early filtering

**3. Physical Selection Works:**
- Selection by physical characteristics is effective
- Supports idea that filter uses physical features
- Early selection based on physical cues

---

### **Problems with Broadbent's Model**

**1. Cocktail Party Effect:**
- **Problem:** People notice their name in unattended ear
- **Challenge:** If filter blocks all unattended information, how can names be detected?
- **Implication:** Some semantic processing must occur before or despite filtering
- **Contradiction:** Suggests late selection or attenuation, not strict early blocking

**2. Meaningful Information Detected:**
- **Problem:** Emotionally significant or personally relevant information penetrates
- **Challenge:** How can meaning be processed if filtering occurs before semantic analysis?
- **Implication:** Semantic analysis may occur before or in parallel with filtering
- **Contradiction:** Filter may not be completely all-or-nothing

**3. Context Effects:**
- **Problem:** Context from unattended message influences processing
- **Challenge:** If unattended information is blocked, how can it provide context?
- **Implication:** Some processing of unattended information must occur
- **Contradiction:** Filter may attenuate rather than block

---

### **Improvements to Broadbent's Model**

#### **Improvement 1: Treisman's Attenuation Model (2 marks)**

**Key Changes:**
- **Attenuation instead of blocking:** Unattended information is weakened (attenuated) rather than completely blocked
- **Analysis of unattended information:** Unattended information receives some analysis
- **Threshold mechanism:** Important information (like one's name) has lower threshold and can penetrate even when attenuated

**How It Works:**
```
Sensory Input
    ↓
Sensory Buffer
    ↓
Attenuator (reduces strength of unattended)
    ↓
    ├─→ Attended Channel (full strength)
    │       ↓
    │   Pattern Recognition
    │       ↓
    │   Semantic Analysis
    │
    └─→ Unattended Channel (weakened)
            ↓
        Pattern Recognition (weaker)
            ↓
        Dictionary Unit (thresholds)
            ↓
        Important info can activate (name)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Attenuator:** Reduces but doesn't eliminate unattended information
- **Dictionary Unit:** Contains words with different thresholds
- **Important Words:** Have lower thresholds (name, danger words)
- **Partial Processing:** Unattended information is processed but weakly

**Advantages:**
- Explains cocktail party effect (name has low threshold)
- Accounts for limited processing of unattended information
- More flexible than strict blocking
- Explains why some unattended information is noticed

---

#### **Improvement 2: Late Selection Models (Deutsch & Deutsch, Norman) (2 marks)**

**Key Changes:**
- **Late Filtering:** Selection occurs after pattern recognition and semantic analysis
- **All Information Processed:** All information receives full analysis
- **Selection at Response:** Filtering occurs when selecting responses, not inputs
- **Capacity Limits at Response:** Bottleneck is at response selection, not perception

**How It Works:**
```
Sensory Input
    ↓
Sensory Buffer
    ↓
Pattern Recognition (ALL channels)
    ↓
Semantic Analysis (ALL channels)
    ↓
Response Selection Filter ← Attention operates here
    ↓
Response
```

**Key Features:**
- **Full Processing:** All information is fully analyzed
- **Late Selection:** Filtering occurs at response stage
- **Response Competition:** Multiple responses compete
- **Relevance Determines Selection:** Most relevant response is selected

**Advantages:**
- Explains why unattended information is processed
- Accounts for context effects
- Explains semantic priming from unattended information
- More consistent with some experimental findings

**Disadvantages:**
- Doesn't explain why so little unattended information is remembered
- Seems inefficient to process everything fully
- Doesn't account for clear differences in attended vs. unattended processing

---

#### **Improvement 3: Resource/Capacity Models (Kahneman) (2 marks)**

**Key Changes:**
- **Limited Resources:** Attention is a limited pool of processing resources
- **Resource Allocation:** Resources are allocated based on task demands and goals
- **Flexible Allocation:** Resources can be divided or focused
- **Arousal and Capacity:** Available capacity varies with arousal

**How It Works:**
- **Central Pool:** Limited pool of attentional resources
- **Allocation Policy:** Determines how resources are distributed
- **Task Demands:** Difficult tasks require more resources
- **Multiple Tasks:** Can share resources if total demand doesn't exceed capacity

**Key Features:**
- **Flexibility:** Resources can be allocated flexibly
- **Division:** Resources can be divided among tasks
- **Capacity Limits:** Total capacity is limited
- **Arousal Effects:** Capacity varies with arousal level

**Advantages:**
- Explains dual-task performance
- Accounts for individual differences
- Explains effects of practice (reduces resource demand)
- More flexible than single-channel models

---

#### **Improvement 4: Feature Integration Theory (Treisman) (1 mark)**

**Key Changes:**
- **Feature Maps:** Different features (color, shape, location) processed in parallel
- **Attention for Binding:** Attention required to bind features into objects
- **Preattentive Processing:** Features processed without attention
- **Focused Attention:** Needed for feature integration

**Contribution to Attention Models:**
- Clarifies role of attention in object perception
- Distinguishes preattentive vs. attentive processing
- Explains feature binding and illusory conjunctions
- Provides mechanism for how attention works
