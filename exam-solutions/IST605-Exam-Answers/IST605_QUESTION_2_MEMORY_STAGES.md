# IST605 - QUESTION 2: THREE STAGES OF MEMORY (6 marks)

**Question:** State and briefly describe the three stages of memory. Your description should include what happens to the stimuli, how long the stimuli last, and the storage capacity of each memory stage.

## Answer: The Three Stages of Memory

The three stages of memory are: **Sensory Memory**, **Short-Term Memory (STM) / Working Memory**, and **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**.

---

### 1. Sensory Memory

**What happens to stimuli:**
- Sensory information is briefly stored in its original sensory form (iconic memory for visual, echoic memory for auditory)
- Information is automatically registered from the environment
- Attention determines which information moves to the next stage

**Duration:**
- Very brief: approximately **250-500 milliseconds** for iconic (visual) memory
- **2-4 seconds** for echoic (auditory) memory
- Information decays rapidly if not attended to

**Storage capacity:**
- **Large but unorganized** - can hold a large amount of raw sensory information
- Exact capacity is difficult to measure, but it stores a rich, detailed representation of the sensory environment
- Capacity is limited by decay time rather than storage space

### 2. Short-Term Memory (STM) / Working Memory

**What happens to stimuli:**
- Information that receives attention from sensory memory enters STM
- Information is actively maintained and manipulated through rehearsal
- Information can be encoded into long-term memory through elaborative rehearsal
- Without rehearsal, information is lost through decay or displacement

**Duration:**
- Approximately **15-30 seconds** without rehearsal
- Can be maintained longer through active rehearsal (maintenance or elaborative)
- Information can be displaced by new incoming information

**Storage capacity:**
- **7 ± 2 items** (George Miller's "magic number")
- Limited capacity - can hold approximately 5-9 chunks of information
- Capacity can be increased through chunking (grouping items into meaningful units)

**Note:** Working Memory is an updated model of STM that includes:
- Phonological loop (verbal information)
- Visuospatial sketchpad (visual-spatial information)
- Episodic buffer (integrates information)
- Central executive (controls attention)

### 3. Long-Term Memory (LTM)

**What happens to stimuli:**
- Information from STM that is deeply processed or rehearsed enters LTM
- Information is organized and stored in networks of related concepts
- Information can be retrieved back to STM when needed
- Information can be consolidated and strengthened over time

**Duration:**
- **Relatively permanent** - can last from minutes to a lifetime
- Some information may decay or be forgotten, but many memories persist indefinitely
- Retrieval can strengthen memories and prevent forgetting

**Storage capacity:**
- **Essentially limitless** - no known maximum capacity
- Can store vast amounts of information throughout a lifetime
- Capacity is limited by retrieval processes rather than storage space

## Summary Table

| Memory Stage | What Happens to Stimuli | Duration | Storage Capacity |
|--------------|------------------------|----------|------------------|
| **Sensory Memory** | Stored in original sensory form; attention determines transfer | 250ms-4s | Large but decays rapidly |
| **Short-Term Memory** | Actively maintained; can be encoded to LTM | 15-30s (without rehearsal) | 7 ± 2 items |
| **Long-Term Memory** | Organized and stored in networks; retrievable | Relatively permanent | Essentially limitless |

## Additional Notes

### Transfer Between Stages:
- **Sensory → STM:** Requires attention
- **STM → LTM:** Requires encoding through rehearsal and deep processing
- **LTM → STM:** Retrieval brings information back to working memory

### Factors Affecting Each Stage:
- **Sensory Memory:** Intensity of stimulus, selective attention
- **STM:** Rehearsal, interference, chunking
- **LTM:** Encoding depth, organization, retrieval cues, interference
