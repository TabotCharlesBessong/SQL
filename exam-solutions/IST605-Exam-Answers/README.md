## Study Tips

### Memory Systems
1. **Understand the three-stage model:**
   - Sensory → Short-Term → Long-Term
   - Know duration and capacity for each stage
   - Understand transfer processes (attention, encoding, retrieval)

2. **Working Memory Components:**
   - Phonological Loop: Verbal/auditory information
   - Visuospatial Sketchpad: Visual/spatial information
   - Episodic Buffer: Integration
   - Central Executive: Control and coordination

3. **Serial Position Effects:**
   - Primacy = beginning items (LTM encoding)
   - Recency = end items (STM availability)
   - Delay eliminates recency but not primacy

### Attention
1. **Capacity Limitations:**
   - Attention is a limited resource
   - Bottleneck occurs during processing
   - Selection is necessary due to capacity constraints

2. **Attention Functions:**
   - Focusing: Selecting relevant information
   - Perceptual Enhancement: Improving processing
   - Binding: Combining features into objects

### Perception
1. **Processing Types:**
   - Bottom-up: Stimulus-driven, starts from sensory input
   - Top-down: Knowledge-driven, uses expectations and prior knowledge

2. **Gestalt Principles:**
   - Proximity, Closure, Similarity, Good Continuation, Figure-Ground
   - "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"

### Concepts and Categories
1. **Classical vs. Probabilistic Views:**
   - Classical: Necessary/sufficient features, sharp boundaries
   - Probabilistic: Characteristic features, fuzzy boundaries, graded membership

2. **Theories:**
   - Prototype Theory: Average/typical member
   - Exemplar Theory: Specific examples
   - Hierarchical Organization: Superordinate, Basic, Subordinate levels

## Important Theories & Models

### Memory Models
- **Atkinson-Shiffrin Model:** Three-stage model (Sensory → STM → LTM)
- **Baddeley-Hitch Working Memory Model:** Four-component model
- **Miller's Magic Number:** 7±2 items in STM

### Attention Models
- **Broadbent's Filter Model:** Early selection filter
- **Treisman's Attenuation Model:** Attenuation rather than complete filtering
- **Late Selection Models:** Selection after processing

### Object Recognition Models
- **Template Matching:** Exact pattern matching
- **Feature Detection:** Feature analysis (Hubel & Wiesel)
- **Recognition-by-Components (RBC):** Biederman's geon-based theory

### Memory Organization Models
- **Hierarchical/Semantic Network Models:** Tree structure, property inheritance
- **ACT Model:** Activation-based, declarative/procedural memory
- **PDP Model:** Distributed representation, parallel processing
