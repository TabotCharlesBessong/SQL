## Study Tips

1. **Concepts and Categories:**
   - Understand the difference between categories (external) and concepts (mental)
   - Know the key differences between classical and probabilistic views
   - Study prototype theory, exemplar theory, and hierarchical views
   - Understand typicality effects and fuzzy boundaries

2. **Attention:**
   - Learn the limits of attention (capacity constraints)
   - Understand the three main functions of attention
   - Study dichotic listening experiments and their findings
   - Know Broadbent's model and how it was improved

3. **Memory Models:**
   - For each model, understand what nodes and links represent
   - Know how each model works (processing mechanisms)
   - Compare and contrast the three models
   - Understand strengths and limitations of each

## Important Concepts

### Categories vs Concepts
- **Categories:** External groupings of objects/events
- **Concepts:** Mental representations of categories

### Classical vs Probabilistic Views
- **Classical:** Necessary/sufficient features, sharp boundaries
- **Probabilistic:** Characteristic features, fuzzy boundaries, graded membership

### Attention Functions
- **Focusing:** Selecting relevant information
- **Perceptual Enhancement:** Improving processing of attended information
- **Binding:** Combining features into objects

### Memory Models
- **Hierarchical:** Tree structure, property inheritance
- **ACT:** Activation-based, declarative/procedural memory
- **PDP:** Distributed representation, parallel processing, connection weights
