## Part (a) - Free Recall Task Definition

**Answer:** In a free recall task, subjects are presented with a list of items (e.g., words) and are asked to recall them in any order after the presentation is complete.

## Part (b) - Graph Analysis

### (i) The Fraction of Words that is Recalled in General

**Answer:** Generally, approximately **20-70%** of words are recalled correctly, with the exact percentage varying significantly depending on serial position.

**Detailed explanation:**
- **No delay condition:** Overall recall ranges from about 20-30% for middle items (positions 5-11) to 50-70% for early and late items (positions 1-3 and 13-15)
- **30-sec delay condition:** Overall recall is generally lower, ranging from about 20-30% for most items, with slightly higher recall (60-70%) only for the first few items
- **Average across all positions:** Approximately 30-40% of words are recalled in the no-delay condition, and approximately 25-30% in the delay condition

---

### (ii) The Primacy Effect

**Answer:** The primacy effect is the tendency to better recall items at the **beginning** of a list (serial positions 1-3), demonstrated by the high percentage correct (60-70%) for early items in both curves.

**Detailed explanation:**
- Both curves show elevated recall for the first few items (positions 1-3)
- In the "No delay" curve: positions 1-3 show approximately 70% correct recall
- In the "30-sec delay" curve: positions 1-3 show approximately 60-70% correct recall
- **Explanation:** Early items receive more rehearsal time and are more likely to be encoded into long-term memory
- Primacy effect is relatively unaffected by the delay because it relies on long-term memory encoding

---

### (iii) The Recency Effect

**Answer:** The recency effect is the tendency to better recall items at the **end** of a list (serial positions 13-15), shown by the high percentage correct (50-55%) for the last few items in the "No delay" curve, but **eliminated** in the "30-sec delay" curve.

**Detailed explanation:**
- **No delay condition:** The last few items (positions 13-15) show a significant rise in recall (50-55%), indicating a recency effect
- **30-sec delay condition:** The recency effect is eliminated - the last items show low recall (20-30%), similar to middle items
- **Explanation:** Recency effect occurs because the last items are still in short-term/working memory when immediate recall is tested
- The 30-second delay allows time for these items to decay from working memory, eliminating the recency effect

---

### (iv) The Serial Positioning Effect

**Answer:** The serial positioning effect (also called serial position effect) is the overall pattern showing better recall for items at the beginning (primacy effect) and end (recency effect) of a list, with poorer recall for middle items, creating a **U-shaped curve**.

**Detailed explanation:**
- The "No delay" curve clearly shows the serial position effect as a U-shaped pattern:
  - **High recall** at the beginning (primacy)
  - **Low recall** in the middle (positions 5-11, around 20-30%)
  - **High recall** at the end (recency)
- The "30-sec delay" curve shows a modified pattern:
  - **High recall** at the beginning (primacy remains)
  - **Low recall** in the middle (similar to no-delay condition)
  - **Low recall** at the end (recency eliminated)
- The serial position effect demonstrates that memory performance depends on an item's position in a sequence

### (v) The Difference and Similarity Between the Two Curves

#### Similarities:

1. **Both show primacy effect:**
   - Both curves show high recall (60-70%) for the first few items (positions 1-3)
   - The primacy effect is similar in magnitude for both conditions

2. **Both show low recall for middle items:**
   - Both curves show a dip in recall for middle positions (approximately positions 5-11)
   - Middle items show approximately 20-30% recall in both conditions
   - This suggests that middle items receive less rehearsal and are poorly encoded

3. **Both demonstrate the overall serial position pattern:**
   - Both curves show that recall varies systematically with serial position
   - Both support the distinction between long-term memory (primacy) and short-term memory (recency)

#### Differences:

1. **Recency effect:**
   - **No delay curve:** Shows a clear recency effect with high recall (50-55%) for the last few items (positions 13-15)
   - **30-sec delay curve:** Recency effect is **eliminated** - last items show low recall (20-30%), similar to middle items
   - **Key difference:** The delay eliminates the recency effect while preserving the primacy effect

2. **Overall recall rate:**
   - **No delay condition:** Higher overall recall, especially for end items (average ~30-40%)
   - **30-sec delay condition:** Lower overall recall, particularly at the end (average ~25-30%)

3. **Shape of the curve:**
   - **No delay:** U-shaped curve (high at beginning, low in middle, high at end)
   - **30-sec delay:** Decaying curve (high at beginning, low throughout the rest, no rise at the end)

4. **Memory systems involved:**
   - **No delay:** Demonstrates both long-term memory (primacy) and short-term/working memory (recency)
   - **30-sec delay:** Demonstrates primarily long-term memory (primacy only), as working memory has decayed

## Summary Table

| Aspect | No Delay Curve | 30-sec Delay Curve |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Primacy Effect** | Yes (70% for positions 1-3) | Yes (60-70% for positions 1-3) |
| **Recency Effect** | Yes (50-55% for positions 13-15) | No (eliminated, ~20-30%) |
| **Middle Items** | Low recall (20-30%) | Low recall (20-30%) |
| **Overall Shape** | U-shaped curve | Decaying curve (no rise at end) |
| **Memory Systems** | LTM (primacy) + STM (recency) | Primarily LTM (primacy only) |

## Theoretical Implications

1. **Dual-store model support:** The pattern supports the distinction between short-term memory (recency) and long-term memory (primacy)

2. **Working memory decay:** The elimination of recency with delay demonstrates that working memory contents decay rapidly (within 30 seconds)

3. **Rehearsal effects:** Primacy effect persists because early items receive more rehearsal and are encoded into LTM

4. **Memory retrieval:** The delay condition shows that recency effect depends on immediate access to working memory, not LTM retrieval
