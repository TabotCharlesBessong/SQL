## 1. Introduction

### What is Cognitive Psychology?
- **Definition:** The study of **cognition** (thought)—i.e., how people **perceive**, **learn**, **remember**, and **think** about information.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Individual components of mental processes can be identified and understood.
  - Internal mental processes can be described by **rules or algorithms** in information-processing models.

### What Cognitive Psychology Studies
- **Knowledge:** acquiring it, organizing it, and using it.
- **Topics include:** sensation, perception, attention, memory, language, reasoning, problem solving, decision making.

### Intuition and Its Limits
- **Intuition:** Relying on judgment to explain behaviour and thought.
- Intuition is only one input to cognition and **can fail or mislead**.
- **Naive realism:** The intuition that perception is “seeing the world as it is.” Research shows this is often false (e.g., two groups watching the same football video and disagreeing on which team was more aggressive).
- **Illusions** illustrate limits of perception:
  - **Shepherd’s tables:** Tables that look different in shape/size but are identical.
  - **Shaded objects:** The visual system often assumes light from above; changing shading can make surfaces look concave vs. convex.
- Despite these flaws, our assumptions are usually correct; **tasks that feel natural to humans are often the hardest to implement in AI**.

### Information Overload
- Huge amounts of information are available; much is irrelevant.
- We must **filter** to focus on what is relevant; it is hard to know in advance what is truly useful.
- **Example (chess):** The number of possible sequences for the first ten moves is enormous; neither humans nor machines can enumerate all options, though machines can explore far more possibilities.

## 2. Framework for Cognitive Psychology

### Human Information Processing Model
- Central framework in cognitive psychology.
- **Basic premise:** People are **like computers** in that we **store**, **retrieve**, and **use** information—a system with inputs and corresponding outputs (a “black box” view).

### Limitation of the Metaphor
- The model **does not** fully capture that humans are **biological**, evolved organisms whose cognition serves **adaptive, functional behaviour**.
- Humans are **not general-purpose computers** but **special-purpose systems** shaped by the demands of their environment.

## 3. Some Related Issues

### (1) Learning
- **Example:** How does a child learn the word “rabbit” when a parent points and says “rabbit”? The child might attend to the finger, the rabbit, or a property (e.g., colour, fur) or category (animals).
- **Under-representation:** The mapping from experience to concept is ambiguous; learning still occurs.
- Humans (and other organisms) seem to have **biases and expectations** that reduce this ambiguity.
- **Example (rat):** A rat associates illness with the **taste/smell of food** it ate (not the cat or a noise); lab work supports this. Biases are often correct but can sometimes be wrong.

### (2) Experience and Reasoning
- **Challenge:** Inferring causes from limited information (e.g., “John greets Mary warmly; she replies in kind. Why is Mary friendly?”—personality, job, John’s behaviour, pretence, etc.).
- People do not usually have enough information to choose between competing explanations and must use **strategies** to attribute beliefs and behaviour.
- **Abnormal conditions:** People tend to attribute causes to **what is unusual** (e.g., blame an accident on rain if rain is unusual; less so if the driver lives in a rainy area).
- Without definitive information, attributions **cannot be logically justified** in most cases; **experience can be incomplete or misleading**.

### (3) Memory
- We often act by relying on **past experience**—i.e., accessing **relevant** memories.
- **Example:** Seeing a snake while climbing—relevant memories are about danger, not “snake rhymes with snowflake.”
- **Central challenge:** Deciding **what is relevant** is difficult; doing it **quickly** is even harder.
- A major goal of memory research is to understand **how memory is organized** so that useful information is available when needed.

## 4. Experience and Experimentation

### How Researchers Study the Mind
- Cognitive psychology aims to understand **how the mind works**; this is addressed through both experience and **systematic experimentation**.

### Intuition vs. Experimentation
- **Intuition:** Judging truth by plausibility (“if it sounds reasonable, it’s probably true”). Example: punishment deters crime.
- Experimentation often supports intuitive beliefs, but **intuition is not infallible**—many intuitive beliefs are wrong. Hence the need for **scientific methods**.

### Empiricism
- **Empiricism:** Knowledge is derived from **experience**—observation and experimentation are used to determine truth.
- Cognitive psychology relies heavily on **scientific observation and experimentation**.

## 5. Roots of Cognitive Psychology

### Two Traditions
- **Philosophical (introspection):** Used in theory building.
- **Biological / observational (empirical):** Used in experimentation today.

### Early Pioneers
- **René Descartes (1596–1650):** Emphasized **rationalism** and **introspection** over observation to study the mind.
- **John Locke (1632–1704):** Emphasized **observation (empiricism)** to study mental processes.
- **Immanuel Kant (1724–1804):** Argued that **both** rationalism and empiricism are needed to understand the mind and reality.

### Introspectionism (Wilhelm Wundt)
- **Idea:** Trained observers could overcome the limits of intuition by careful analysis (e.g., like analyzing shading and depth in art).
- **Goal:** Understand the **structure of consciousness** (perception and thought)—breaking thought into elements, as physical things can be broken into parts.
- **Problems:** Perception and behaviour involve **unconscious** as well as conscious processes; introspective experiments did not reliably reveal the structure of thought.

### Behaviourism
- **Focus:** Psychology as the study of **behaviour**; goals are **prediction and control** of behaviour.
- **Unit of behaviour:** The **reflex**—an automatic response to a perceived stimulus.
- Emphasized **reinforcement** and patterns of behaviour.
- **Problem:** **Ignored thought and consciousness** entirely.

### The Cognitive Approach
- Human behaviour can be explained by **information-processing** (scientific) processes.
- Behaviour is a series of **responses to external stimuli**.
- Behaviour is controlled by **thought processes**, not (only) genetic factors.

| Learning | Under-representation; biases help resolve ambiguity |
| Reasoning | Causal attribution; bias toward abnormal conditions |
| Memory | Relevance and organization for quick, useful access |
| Empiricism | Knowledge from observation and experimentation |
| Introspectionism | Structure of consciousness; limited by unconscious processes |
| Behaviourism | Behaviour and reflexes; ignored consciousness |
| Cognitive approach | Behaviour as result of thought processes and external stimuli |
