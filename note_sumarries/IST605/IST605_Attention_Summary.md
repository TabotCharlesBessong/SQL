## 1. What is Attention For?

### Definition and Facets
- **Attention** has multiple meanings in daily speech:
  - **Concentration:** Attending to a lecture
  - **Selection:** Attending to a particular conversation in a crowded room
  - **Capacity limits:** Being able to attend to only so many things at once
  - **Automaticity:** No longer needing to attend to well-practiced skills (conscious monitoring no longer necessary)

### Common Theme
- Recognition that people **cannot do an infinite number of different things simultaneously**
- With practice, we improve at doing many things at once
- **Goal of cognitive theories:** Explain types of limitations in information processing and how people learn to deal with them

### Why Are There Limits?
**Two possibilities:**

1. **Environmental complexity:** Cannot process all information as the environment becomes complex
   - Example: Finding a guest at an empty airport is easy; finding them among many people is harder

2. **System noise:** Perceptual and cognitive systems are noisy
   - We do not perceive everything exactly as it appears
   - We do not make decisions perfectly all the time

### Ideal Observer Analysis
- **Tool/method:** Investigates how information is processed in perceptual systems
- **Ideal observer:** A theoretical system that performs a task optimally
- **Ideal performance:** The theoretical upper limit; real systems typically achieve sub-ideal performance
- If there is uncertainty, perfect performance is impossible and the ideal observer will make errors

### Reasons to Limit Information Processing

**(A) Too many possibilities**
- Too many signals from the environment to consider all efficiently
- Limiting items reduces the number of combinations to entertain
- Keeps possibilities manageable and prevents overwhelm

**(B) Action systems are limited**
- We have only two legs and arms; cannot grasp more than two things at once
- Cannot move in more than one direction simultaneously
- When speaking, can only say one word at a time
- Attention transforms parallel-processed information into a form that facilitates action

## 2. Functions of Attention

### Five Main Functions

1. **Focusing**
   - Limiting the number of items being processed
   - Example: Looking only at people with brown hair when searching for a friend

2. **Perceptual Enhancement**
   - Increasing the gain (strength) of a stimulus in the environment
   - Attention as concentration
   - Analogy: Turning up car radio volume to hear better
   - **Works when:** Signal is clear (turning up volume helps drown out noise)
   - **Fails when:** Signal has static noise (turning up volume amplifies noise too)

3. **Binding**
   - Combining perceptual information about different properties into a percept of a single object
   - Example: In low-level vision, edges are identified separately; binding brings them together to create a coherent object

4. **Sustaining Behaviour**
   - Maintaining an action in the presence of potential distractions
   - Attention may be captured by salient events (loud sounds, flashing lights)
   - Even with distractions, it is possible to concentrate on a single perceptual object to the exclusion of others

5. **Action Selection**
   - Choosing an action to be performed from among a set of possibilities
   - We are limited by actions we can perform
   - Some mechanism must select and order actions

## 3. Perceptual Attention

### Sensory Stores
- **Sensory store:** Records sensory information automatically; information decays after a brief period; very high capacity
- **Iconic memory:** Visual sensory store
- **Echoic memory:** Auditory sensory store
- **Evidence:** Information persists briefly (e.g., looking out a car window—you perceive much, but recall fades quickly as new signals arrive)

### Focusing: Selecting Channels

**Dichotic listening experiments:**
- Different messages played to each ear through headphones
- Participants tested on messages heard

**Results:**
- When told to attend to one ear: People are aware a voice was present in the other ear but cannot say much beyond that (not even the language)
- Even without instructions: People attend to only one channel at a time
  - Example: Messages {6, 2, 9} to one ear and {4, 7, 3} to the other are recalled as {6, 2, 9, 4, 7, 3}, not alternating {6, 4, 2, 7, 9, 3}

**Key observations:**
- Focusing does not mean other input is completely suppressed
- Salient stimuli (loud noises, flashing lights) command attention by virtue of extremeness
- **Selective attention:** Ability to recognize significant events outside momentary focus (e.g., hearing your name in a conversation you were not part of)

**Fundamental question:** What are the limits on selecting the most relevant input and being aware of significant events outside the focus of attention?

### Perceptual Enhancement

**Two ways attending might make perceptual processing more efficient:**

1. **Makes perceptual input stronger:** Amplifies both signal and external noise
2. **Decreases internal noise:** Reduces errors in neuron functioning, making internal representation and processing more efficient

**Evidence:** Attention makes perceptual input stronger; processing is helped by reducing external noise (which is not amplified along with the signal)
- Examples: Increasing contrast between objects and backgrounds; shutting a car window to filter external noise while turning on the radio

## 4. Attentional Limits

### Location of Attentional Limits

**Sensory stores:** Provide vast storage capacity  
**Dichotic listening:** Suggests eventual processing of sensed signals is limited

### Bottleneck Theories of Attention

**Basic assumption:** All inputs are processed completely up to a certain stage; only attended channels are processed more fully after that

**Broadbent's Filter/Bottleneck Model:**
- **Central processing system:** Receives inputs from sensory channels; compares them with memory to determine meaning
- **Selective filter:** Prevents overload by sifting incoming stimuli
  - Lets through stimuli with certain properties
  - Excludes others
- **Application (party conversation):** Filter screens out non-speech sounds; sounds with certain properties (e.g., voice of conversation partner) are admitted to the attended channel
- **Filter characteristics:**
  - Flexible (can shift attention to a different conversation)
  - Can only use lower-level auditory characteristics (e.g., loudness), not meaning
  - Bottleneck: Filter cannot shift back and forth across channels fast enough to follow two conversations at once
- **Early selection theory:** Filtering occurs early in processing

**Improvements to Broadbent's Theory:**
- **Problem:** Oversimplified; subjects notice their names in unattended channels
- **Expanded model (three stages):**
  1. **Stage 1:** Incoming stimuli analyzed for physical characteristics (pitch, speech vs non-speech); decisions/responses can be made (e.g., who is speaking)
  2. **Stage 2:** Stimuli checked against permanent memory list of high-priority messages (danger signals, vocal patterns of one's name); such stimuli are attended to
  3. **Stage 3:** Stimuli not selected at Stage 2 matched against current priorities
     - High priority: Sounds matching conversation partner's voice
     - Low priority: Other voices, non-speech sounds
     - Low priority signals ignored; high priority moved up for further processing (comprehension)

**Role of expectation:** A person's expectations influence what information is processed

**Late Selection:**
- Some research suggests bottlenecks occur after stimuli have been recognized and placed in short-term memory
- Information in short-term memory that is not rehearsed or elaborated is likely to be forgotten

### Capacity Theories of Attention

**Basis:**
- Limited pool of attentional resources
- Resources are depleted as information is processed

**Implications:**
- Two tasks that do not need too much cognitive effort should not interfere with each other
- Whether two tasks interfere depends on how much they draw on the same resource pools
- Resources can be allocated; if one task is more important, resources can be devoted to it at the expense of another

**Resource pools:**
- Evidence suggests **multiple pools** (e.g., visual tasks vs auditory tasks)
- Explains why auditory and visual tasks can be performed together more easily than two visual or two auditory tasks

### Binding

**Definition:** Binding perceptual features together into a coherent representation of objects

**Process:**
- Objects consist of properties at a single spatial location (e.g., colour and shape: red triangle)
- Properties initially processed independently (as shape and as colour)
- At some point, information is brought back together—this is binding

**Visual Search Task:**
- Display with multiple objects; search for a target (e.g., red circle)
- **Single feature search:** Easy (e.g., red T among blue letters)
  - Consistent with idea that focusing on a single dimension (colour) makes it easy to distinguish values (red vs blue)
- **Conjunction search:** Difficult (e.g., red T among red Ls and blue Ts)
  - More difficult searching for a conjunction of properties (colour AND letter T)
- **Search time:**
  - Single feature: Does not increase with display size
  - Conjunction: Increases with display size

**Feature Integration Theory:**
- **Pre-attentive stage:** Different brain parts automatically gather information about basic features (colours, shape, movement) found in the visual field
- **Focused attention stage:** Individual features are combined to perceive the whole object
  - Requires attention
  - Selecting an object occurs within a "master map of locations"
  - Master map contains all locations where features have been detected
  - When attention is focused at a particular location, features at that position are attended to

**Conjunction of features:**
- Two features are part of the same object if they occupy the same location in space and time
- Example: Green triangle = co-occurrence of green and triangle at the same spatial location
- Must combine "what" (triangle, green) and "where" (location) information
- Neuropsychological evidence: "What" and "where" systems are neuroanatomically separable, parallel systems

## 5. Capacity and Automaticity

### Automaticity
- **Most stringent view:** A process is automatic if it requires no cognitive resources
- **More common:** Automaticity means a significant reduction in perceived difficulty
- **Evidence:** Whether practice leads to reduced attentional demands depends on type of practice and task structure

### Research on Automaticity: Visual Search with Practice

**Typical scenario:** Visual search task
- Subject tells if a target (e.g., T) appears in a display (e.g., BKQR) shown briefly
- **Sternberg (1966) result:** Time to say target is in display increases by 35–40 ms per item
  - Example: 320 ms base + (2 items × 35–40 ms) = 390–400 ms

**Two scenarios with practice:**

1. **Consistent mapping:**
   - If an item is a target on one trial, it never appears as a distractor
   - Target set and distractor set do not overlap
   - Example: Detecting a letter among digits (or digit among letters)
   - **Result:** Reaction time lower; search time per additional item substantially lower

2. **Varied mapping:**
   - Distractor set and target set overlap
   - Example: Detect a letter among other letters (or digit among other digits)
   - A given letter may appear as target on some trials, as distractor on others
   - **Result:** Reaction time lower (learning helped), but time per additional item increases by a constant amount (as in Sternberg)

**Implication:** Consistent mapping leads to more automatic processing (less attention per item) than varied mapping.
